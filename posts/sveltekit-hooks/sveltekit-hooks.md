## What Are Hooks?

Hooks can mean different things depending where you come from but in the case of SvelteKit hooks are just another name for **middleware**.

Middleware is a name for a function that intercepts a **request** to the server before it's completed and lets you modify the **response**.

{% img src="hooks.webp" alt="Diagram describing how hooks work" %}

Here are some of the things hooks are used for:
- Authentication
- Modifying the response
- Error and performance logging
- Creating automatic routes

SvelteKit uses a special `hooks.server.ts` or `hooks.client.ts` file to respond to specific events on the server and client and provides **server hooks** like **handle** and **handleFetch** and **shared hooks** like **handleError**.

Instead of boring you with theory I want to show you some real world examples of using hooks to spark your imagination.

## Creating Routes

The most used and powerful hook is the **handle** hook which runs each time the SvelteKit server receives a [request](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request)  and determines the [response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response).

I'm going to create a file inside `src/hooks.server.ts` and use the `handle` hook from SvelteKit.

```ts:src/hooks.server.ts showLineNumbers
import type { Handle } from '@sveltejs/kit'

export const handle: Handle = async ({ event, resolve }) => {
  return resolve(event)
}
```

If you didn't add a hooks file this is the default behavior.

The `handle` function takes an `input` object that has `event` and `resolve`. The `event` object has the **request** and `resolve` is a function that renders the route and creates the **response**.

If you wanted you could turn every route in your app into a banana.

```ts:src/hooks.server.ts showLineNumbers
import type { Handle } from '@sveltejs/kit'

export const handle: Handle = async ({ event, resolve }) => {
  return new Response('üçå')
}
```

Notice that even if you go to a route that doesn't exist it's going to return a banana ‚Äî in that case you might want to be more precise.

```ts:src/hooks.server.ts showLineNumbers
import type { Handle } from '@sveltejs/kit'

export const handle: Handle = async ({ event, resolve }) => {
  // if route matches "/banana" return banana
  if (event.url.pathname.startsWith('/banana')) {
    return new Response('üçå')
  }

  // otherwise use the default behavior
  return resolve(event)
}
```

You just created a route through code which can be useful if you're making some library and don't want to make the user create a route.

Let's look at more examples that use hooks.

## Authentication

Since hooks happen on every request they're a perfect candidate for authentication inside of which you can read or set a cookie and talk to a database.

I have an entire post on [authentication using cookies in SvelteKit](https://joyofcode.xyz/sveltekit-authentication-using-cookies) if you want to learn more but if you use an auth library it's going to provide a hook that has the auth logic.

```ts:src/hooks.server.ts showLineNumbers
import type { Handle } from '@sveltejs/kit'

export const handle: Handle = async ({ event, resolve }) => {
  // this cookie would be set inside a login route
  // const session = event.cookies.get('session')

  // you can get the user data from a database
  // const user = await getUser(session)

  // this is passed to `event` inside server `load` functions
  // and passed to handlers inside `+page.ts`
  event.locals.user = 'Test'

  return resolve(event)
}
```

You can pass any data you want like user data in this example to a request. The populated `event.locals` object becomes available inside server `load` functions and handlers inside `+page.ts`.

```ts:src/routes/+layout.server.ts showLineNumbers
import type { LayoutServerLoad } from './$types'

export const load: LayoutServerLoad = async ({ locals }) => {
  return { user: locals.user }
}
```

In a previous part we learned that data sent from a layout `load` function gets merged with `data` in child routes but it also becomes available inside the `$page.data` store.

```html:src/routes/+page.svelte showLineNumbers
<script lang="ts">
  import { page } from '$app/stores'
</script>  

{#if $page.data.user}
  Welcome {$page.data.user}!
{/if}
```

The authentication runs on every request which is going to update `event.locals` inside the hook and in turn updates `$page.data`.

If you're looking for a SvelteKit auth library that just works I recommend trying out [Lucia](https://lucia-auth.vercel.app/).

## Transforming HTML

If you do internalization you want to be able to change the `<html>` language attribute to the user locale.

```html:src/app.html showLineNumbers
<html lang="%lang%">
```

The `resolve` function has a second parameter that gives you more control how to render the response. One of the options is the `transformPageChunk` function that you can use to change the HTML.

```ts:src/hooks.server.ts showLineNumbers
import type { Handle } from '@sveltejs/kit'

export const handle: Handle = async ({ event, resolve }) => {
  // you can get the locale from `event.cookies`
  const locale = 'hr'

  // pass to `event.locals` as before
  event.locals.locale = locale

  return resolve(event, {
    // replace the `lang` attribute
    transformPageChunk: ({ html }) => html.replace('%lang%', locale),
  })
}
```

The HTML is just a string, so you have to be careful you return proper HTML.

##  Measuring Page Load Speed

You can use hooks to measure how long a response takes and provide logs in development, so you're aware of potential problems.

```ts:src/hooks.server.ts showLineNumbers
import type { Handle } from '@sveltejs/kit'

export const handle: Handle = async ({ event, resolve }) => {
  const route = event.url

  let start = performance.now()
  const response = await resolve(event)
  let end = performance.now()

  let responseTime = end - start

  if (responseTime > 2000) {
    console.log(`üê¢ ${route} took ${responseTime.toFixed(2)} ms`)
  }

  if (responseTime < 1000) {
    console.log(`üöÄ ${route} took ${responseTime.toFixed(2)} ms`)
  }

  return response
}
```

If the response takes longer than `2000 ms` then you log a turtle but if it's under `1000 ms` you can log a rocket.

## Error Logging

You can use services like [Sentry](https://sentry.io/) or [LogRocket](https://logrocket.com/) to get more insight how your site is performing including error tracking.

This is a perfect use case for the `handleError` hook in SvelteKit which is a shared hook you can use to log client and server errors.

The `handleError` function is going to run if an unexpected error is thrown during loading or rendering.

```ts:src/routes/+page.server.ts
import type { PageServerLoad } from './$types'

export const load: PageServerLoad = async () => {
  // this error message including the stack trace
  // can be handled securely on the server
  throw new Error('The secret phrase is banana')
}
```

```ts:src/hooks.server.ts showLineNumbers
import type { HandleServerError } from '@sveltejs/kit'

export const handleError: HandleServerError = async ({ error, event }) => {
  // you can capture the `error` and `event` from the server
  console.log(error)

  return {
    // don't show sensitive data to the user
    message: 'Yikes! üí©',
  }
}
```

You can log or pass the error to some error tracking service and you can show a message that doesn't include sensitive data like the stack trace to the user.

One thing you should know is that the `handleError` inside `hooks.client.ts` only runs if the unexpected error happens inside `+page.ts` which is a current limitation of Svelte despite the SvelteKit docs saying otherwise.

```ts:src/hooks.client.ts showLineNumbers
import type { HandleClientError } from '@sveltejs/kit'

export const handleError: HandleClientError = async ({ error, event }) => {
  // you can capture the `error` and `event` from the client
  // but it only runs if the unexpected error comes from `+page.ts`
  console.log(error)

  return {
    // don't show sensitive data to the user
    message: 'Yikes! üí©',
  }
}
```

## Modifying A Fetch Response

You can use the `handleFetch` hook to modify a `fetch` **request** in a `load` or `action` function that runs on the server.

To be honest I don't know a lot of use cases for this one other than to make a direct request on the server instead of going through a proxy but you might have a use case for it.

Let's say I want every request to use [HTTPS](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/HTTPS).

```ts:src/routes/+page.server.ts showLineNumbers
import type { PageServerLoad } from './$types'

export const load: PageServerLoad = async ({ fetch }) => {
  await fetch('http://joyofcode.xyz/') // yikes! üëéÔ∏è
}
```

I'm going to listen to any request URL that starts with `http` and create a new [Request](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request).

```ts:src/hooks.server.ts showLineNumbers
import type { HandleFetch } from '@sveltejs/kit'

export const handleFetch: HandleFetch = ({ request, fetch }) => {
  if (request.url.startsWith('http')) {
    const url = request.url.replace('http', 'https')
    request = new Request(url, request)
    
    console.log(request.url) // https://joyofcode.xyz/ üëç

    // you can set the request headers
    request.headers.set('x-secure', 'Blessed')

    // you can pass cookies for cross-origin requests
    request.headers.set('cookie', event.request.headers.get('cookie'))
  }

  return fetch(request)
}
```

How awesome is that? üòÑ

## Parsing Form Data

This is something cool I learned from [@stolinski](https://twitter.com/stolinski) from the [sk-form-data](https://github.com/stolinski/sk-form-data) hook he made that makes it easier to work with forms in SvelteKit.

There's a lot of boilerplate when working with forms because you have to parse individual values using [FormData](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData/FormData) or loop over the values but you can make a hook that listens to a `POST` request and gives you the parsed form data you can validate using [Zod](https://zod.dev/).

```ts:src/hooks.server.ts showLineNumbers
import type { Handle } from '@sveltejs/kit'
import { parseFormData } from 'parse-nested-form-data'

export const handle: Handle = async ({ event, resolve }) => {
  // listen to a "POST" request
  if (event.request.method === 'POST') {
    // get the form data from the request
    const formData = await event.request.formData()

    // parse the form data into a JSON object
    const data = parseFormData(formData)

    // make it available inside `actions`
    event.locals.formData = data
  }

  return resolve(event)
}
```

Use a form the same as you would before and keep in mind the `name` attribute is important for the values.

```html:src/routes/+page.svelte showLineNumbers
<script lang="ts">
  import { enhance } from '$app/forms'
</script>

<form method="POST" use:enhance>
  <label for="username">
    Username
    <input type="text" name="username" id="username" />
  </label>

  <label for="password">
    Password
    <input type="password" name="password" id="password" />
  </label>

  <label for="remember">
    <input type="checkbox" name="&remember" id="remember" />
    Remember me
  </label>

  <button type="submit">Log in</button>
</form>
```

Inside your form actions you get access to the parsed form data.

```ts:src/routes/+page.server.ts showLineNumbers
import type { Actions } from '@sveltejs/kit'

export const actions: Actions = {
  default: async ({ locals }) => {
    console.log(locals.formData) // { username: 'Test', password: '1234', remember: true }
    
    // ...
  },
}
```

If you're using TypeScript you have to type `Locals` inside `src/app.d.ts`.

```ts:src/app.d.ts showLineNumbers
declare global {
  namespace App {
    interface Locals {
      formData: Record<string, unknown>
    }
  }
}

export {}
```

Form input values can only be strings which is weird when you're dealing with a checkbox because it returns a `on` value when checked but `parse-nested-form-data` is neat because you can prefix the name prop with `&` and it's going to transform the value into a boolean.

## Using Multiple Hooks Together

You can use the `sequence` helper function from SvelteKit if you want to use multiple hooks together.

```ts:hooks.server.ts showLineNumbers
const auth: Handle = async ({ event, resolve }) => {
  // auth hook logic
  console.log('auth hook')

  return resolve(event)
}

const i18n: Handle = async ({ event, resolve }) => {
  // internationalization hook logic
  console.log('internationalization hook')

  return resolve(event)
}

export const handle = sequence(auth, i18n)
```

That's it! üòÑ

SvelteKit hooks are very powerful and I hope you now understand how they work and when to reach for them if you have to.
