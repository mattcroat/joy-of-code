# Use The Simpler CSS Color Syntax

The CSS specification is a living standard. Instead of shipping large releases that takes years for features to hit browsers, we get them when they're ready.

## CSS Features Are Split Into Modules, and Levels

Features of CSS are split into modules, and levels such as [CSS Flexbox](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox-1/), or [CSS Grid](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-grid-1/).

The [CSS Color Module Level 4](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-4/) specification adds:

- Commaless syntaxes for the `rgb()`, `rgba()`, `hsl()`, and `hsla()` functions
- Allows alpha values in `rgb()` and `hsl()`, turning `rgba()` and `hsla()` into (deprecated) aliases for them
- Adds 4, and 8 digits hex color values, where the last digit(s) represents the alpha value

A lot of these features aren't new, but they're not used frequently either.

## Hex

Hex codes are probably what you're used to.

```css:example.css
/* hex code */
.element {
  color: #008080;
}

/* hex shorthand */
.element {
  color: #088;
}
```

How the shorthand works is that you abbreviate each color channel using one character to represent red, green, and blue values.

For example `#008080` can be read as `00 80 80` — so the shorthand would be `#088`.

**Did you know you can add opacity to a hex color?**

Doing so changes the hex code format from #RRGGBB to #RRGGBBAA (8 digits), or #RGBA (4 digits) for the shorthand.

```css:example.css
.element {
  /* rgba */
  color: rgba(0, 128, 128, 50%);

  /* hexa (hex + alpha) */
  color: #00808080;

  /* hexa shorthand */
  color: #0888;
}
```

**Keep in mind the opacity value is represented in hexadecimal.**

## RGB

If you're using `rgb()`, you can write it like this instead since the former syntax is going to be deprecated.

```css:example.css
/* rgb */
.element {
  color: rgba(0 128 128);
}

/* rgba */
.element {
  color: rgba(0 128 128 / 50%);
}
```

## HSL

I have a strong preference for `hsl()` which I plan to cover in another post.

For one it makes it easier to create, and reason about your design system than other values since:

- **Hue** is just a degree on the color wheel from **0 to 360** (red to blue)
- **Saturation** is a percentage where **0% is gray**, and **100% is the full color**
- **Lightness** is a percentage where **0% is black**, and **50% is normal**

```scss:example.css
/* hsl */
.element {
  color: hsl(180 100% 25%);
}

/* hsla */
.element {
  color: hsla(180 100% 25% / 50%);
}
```

You can also use decimal values instead of percentages for the opacity, but I prefer to be explicit.

Thanks for reading. ❤️ Hope you learned something!
