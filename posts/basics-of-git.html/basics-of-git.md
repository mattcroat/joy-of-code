# Basics of Git

Git is a popular distributed version control system that is widely used by developers and development teams to manage their source code. Git allows developers to track changes made to their codebase, collaborate with others, and easily revert to previous versions if necessary. In this blog, we will go over the basics of Git, including how to install Git, create a Git repository, and work with Git commands.

## Installing Git

The first step in using Git is to install it on your computer. Git can be installed on Windows, Mac, and Linux systems. To install Git, follow these steps:

1. Visit the Git website: https://git-scm.com/
2. Download the appropriate version of Git for your operating system.
3. Install Git by following the installation wizard.

## Creating a Git Repository

After installing Git, the next step is to create a Git repository. A repository is a directory where Git stores all the files and their versions. To create a new Git repository, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt window.
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to create the repository.
3. Run the command: `git init`

This will create a new Git repository in the current directory.

## Working with Git Commands

Once you have a Git repository, you can start using Git commands to manage your codebase. Here are some basic Git commands that you should know:

1. `git add`: This command adds files to the staging area. The staging area is where you prepare files for committing to the repository. For example, to add a file called "example.txt" to the staging area, run the command: `git add example.txt`

2. `git commit`: This command creates a new commit with the changes you have staged. A commit is a snapshot of your code at a particular point in time. To commit changes, run the command: `git commit -m "Commit message"`

3. `git status`: This command shows the status of your Git repository. It shows which files are in the staging area and which files have been modified but not yet staged. To check the status of your repository, run the command: `git status`

4. `git log`: This command shows the commit history of your repository. It shows the commit message, author, date, and SHA hash of each commit. To view the commit history, run the command: `git log`

5. `git pull`: This command pulls changes from a remote repository into your local repository. This is useful when working with a team or when you want to update your local repository with changes from a remote repository. To pull changes, run the command: `git pull`

## Conclusion

In conclusion, Git is a powerful tool that is essential for any developer or development team. With Git, you can easily manage your source code, collaborate with others, and revert to previous versions if necessary. By following the basics outlined in this blog, you should be able to get started with Git and start using it in your projects.
