# Create a JavaScript Code Sandbox

{% embed src="https://javascriptsandbox.netlify.app" title="JavaScript Sandbox" %}

## Table of Contents

## Introduction

If you ever used [Codepen](https://codepen.io/), [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/), or [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/) you're familiar with what a **code sandbox** is.

Creating a **code sandbox** is surprisingly simple to make yourself, and fun to extend.

You can create a simple **CodePen** if you want with the knowledge you learn, but I want to create a more educational **code sandbox** as a **learning tool** that's able to:

- Load **npm packages** from a **URL** using [Skypack](https://www.skypack.dev/)
- Render **HTML** to an `<iframe>`
- Display **error messages** from the console
- Show the **transpiled** output of [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) to be able to see the **JavaScript** created under the hood when using [React](https://reactjs.org/), or **transpiling** newer to older versions of **JavaScript**

I want to start simple from a `<textarea>` to adding the [Monaco Editor](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/) that powers [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) at the end.

We're going to use the **build tool** [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) to get a nice development environment. **It's alright if you don't know TypeScript** because you can just ignore the types, and keep the filename as `*.js`. Everything is going to work the same — I just like using **TypeScript**.

You can visit the [JavaScript Sandbox](https://javascriptsandbox.netlify.app/) above, and get the [starter and finished project files](https://github.com/joysofcode/javascript-sandbox) on **GitHub**.

## What's an Iframe?

Let's start by playing detective 🔎, and examining **CodePen** source code through the lens of our **developer tools**. This part is **optional**, as I only want to share my thought process with you.

If you're in a new pen on **CodePen**, press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>I</kbd> to bring up the **developers tools**. Notice something interesting by **inspecting** the right-hand column. It's an [iframe](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe). You can imagine an `<iframe>` as a separate page inside another page. By definition **"it's a nested browsing context, embedding another HTML page into the current one."**

{% img src="codepen.webp" alt="CodePen" %}

An `<iframe>` behaves just like a regular page, but contained into it's own microcosm. This sounds like the perfect spot for a **sandbox**. We can already make a couple of observations:

- The `<iframe>` behaves just like a regular page
- User inputs something on the left side (regular page)
- Output displays on in the `<iframe>` the right
- We can execute **JavaScript**

These online editors are just using a fancy `<textarea>` that does **syntax highlighting**, and **code completion** among other things. **CodePen** uses [CodeMirror](https://codemirror.net/). **CodeSandbox** on the other hand is a lot more involved, and it's basically an **integrated development environment** (IDE) inside your browser using the **Monaco Editor** just like **VS Code**.

## Project Setup

Create a project using **Vite**. Confirm, and name your project from the questions it asks you. From the **framework options** select **vanilla**, and pick **vanilla-ts**, or **vanilla** if you don't want to use **TypeScript**.

```shell:terminal
npm init vite@latest
```

Install **npm** dependencies with `npm i`, and start the development server with `npm run dev`. Open `http://localhost:3000/`.

You can also just use the [starter project files](https://github.com/joysofcode/javascript-sandbox) that include the styles we're going to need.

```shell:terminal
git clone https://github.com/joysofcode/javascript-sandbox.git
```

This is the **project structure** you should end up with at the end. There's more files as placeholders we're going to work in.

```shell:structure
├─ public/
│  ├─ iframe.css
│  ├─ image.gif
├─ src/
│  ├─ lib/
│  ├─ styles/
│  │  ├─ style.css
│  ├─ types/
│  │  ├─ index.ts
│  ├─ utils/
│  ├─ main.ts
│  ├─ vite-env.d.ts
.gitignore
favicon.svg
index.html
package.json
tsconfig.json
```

## Hooking Up The DOM

Inside `index.html` the only interesting thing to focus on is our page markup.

```html:index.html showLineNumbers
<div class="loading" data-loading>
  <div class="loader"></div>
  <h1>Loading Sandbox</h1>
</div>

<section class="code">
  <textarea class="editor" spellcheck="false" data-editor></textarea>
</section>

<section class="result">
  <div class="output">
    <iframe data-iframe></iframe>
    <div class="errors" data-errors></div>
  </div>
  <div class="source" data-source></div>
</section>
```

I prefer to use **class** for styling, and [global data-\* attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/data-*) to hook into with **JavaScript** because **class** names could always change.

There's only **two** sections, the **left-hand** side for the **editor**, and **right-hand** side for the **output** and **errors**. We're going to use a simple show and hide to only show the `<iframe>` if there are no errors, and vice versa.

{% img src="diagram.webp" alt="CodePen" %}

We're going to start with a simple `<textarea>` for the **editor**, and disable `spellcheck` because we don't want it.

Let's create some useful **helpers** in **utils** such as `getElement` to let us query the **DOM** easier, and export the elements, so they're easier to use. Let's also add the `showIframe`, and `showErrors` functions.

```ts:src/utils/dom.ts showLineNumbers
export function getElement(targetElement: string): HTMLElement {
  const element = document.querySelector(targetElement)

  if (!element) {
    throw new Error(`Element '${targetElement}' doesn't exist.`)
  }

  return element as HTMLElement
}

export function showIframe(): void {
  elements.iframe.style.display = 'block'
  elements.errors.style.display = 'none'
}

export function showError(): void {
  elements.iframe.style.display = 'none'
  elements.errors.style.display = 'block'
}

export const elements = {
  iframe: getElement('[data-iframe]') as HTMLIFrameElement,
  errors: getElement('[data-errors]') as HTMLDivElement,
  editor: getElement('[data-editor]') as HTMLDivElement,
  source: getElement('[data-source]') as HTMLDivElement,
  loading: getElement('[data-loading]') as HTMLDivElement,
}
```

Using an element is going to be less error prone using `elements.element` with the help of code completion.

## Updating the User Interface

Using **state** is going to make it simple to update the **user interface**, **reduce errors**, and **impossible states** (for simplicity we're just using **global variables**).

```ts:src/main.ts showLineNumbers
import { elements, showError, showIframe } from './utils/dom'

import type { ErrorMessageType, StateType } from './types'

let state: StateType = 'editing'
let errorMessage: ErrorMessageType = ''

function updateUI(): void {
  if (state === 'editing') {
    // ...
    return
  }

  if (state === 'error') {
    // ...
    return
  }

  throw new Error(`State ${state} should not be possible. 💥`)
}
```

We're always going to know what state the application is thanks to `state`. Once we set state to **editing** we can update the user interface with `updateUI`.

If you want to learn **TypeScript** I have an entire [TypeScript Fundamentals](https://joyofcode.xyz/typescript-fundamentals) post. 😎

You can look at the `src/types/index.ts` types if you're curious. If you don't care about **TypeScript** just ignore types completely.

```ts:src/types/index.ts showLineNumbers
export type StateType = 'editing' | 'error'
export type ErrorMessageType = string

export interface TranspiledCodeType {
  iframeCode: string
  sourceCode: string
}
```

You could also use an [enum](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/enums.html) for **state**, or if using **JavaScript** a regular object.

```ts:example.ts showLineNumbers
// index.ts
export enum State {
  Editing = 'editing',
  Error = 'error'
}

// main.ts
import { State } from './types'
let state = State.Editing
```

## Adding Event Listeners

Let's make sure we **update the user interface** when you type something inside the **editor**.

```ts:src/main.ts
elements.editor.addEventListener('keyup', updateUI)
```

We don't want to instantly update the **user interface** because it would be annoying for the user to instantly get an error on the screen as they type. Instead we're going to wrap `updateUI` with a `debounce` function that's going to wait at least **500 ms**, or **0.5 seconds** before updating the **user interface**.

```js:src/utils/helpers.ts showLineNumbers
export function debounce(callback: () => void, delay = 500): () => void {
  let timerId: NodeJS.Timeout

  return () => {
    clearTimeout(timerId)
    timerId = setTimeout(callback, delay)
  }
}
```

The `debounce` function accepts a `callback` function it executes inside `setTimeout`, and a `delay` with a default value of **500 ms**. The reason it returns a function is because of [closures](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures), which creates a new environment each time that cancels the last request out. If we just used `setTimeout`, it would stack them on top of each other.

```ts:src/main.ts showLineNumbers
import { debounce } from './utils/helpers'

elements.editor.addEventListener('keyup', debounce(updateUI))
```

We're also going to add an **event listener** to listen for **errors** on the page. This is going to let us update **state**, set the **errorMessage**, and **update the user interface**.

```ts:src/main.ts showLineNumbers
window.addEventListener('error', ({ error }: ErrorEvent) => {
  state = 'error'
  errorMessage = error.message
  updateUI()

  // if there is no longer an `error` on the page
  state = 'editing'
})
```

`error` is destructured from `event.error` that has a couple of properties but we're only interested in `error.message`, so we use it to set `errorMessage`.

If there are no **errors** on the page it won't run again, so the **state** is going to be set to **editing**.

There's also a **loading indicator** inside `index.html` that gets removed after the page loads. We already have a reference to `loading` inside `src/utils/dom.ts`.

```ts:src/main.ts
window.addEventListener('load', () => elements.loading.remove())
```

## Showing Output

We need to update the contents of the `<iframe>`, and show the **transpiled code** inside **output** each time `updateUI` runs among other things:

- Show the `<iframe>` if `state === 'editing'`
- Get the value of `<textarea>` on each update
- Create a `transpileCode` function to **transpile** the code using **Babel** that returns `iframeCode`, and `sourceCode` we can pass to their respective `updateIframe`, and `updateSource` functions

```ts:src/main.ts showLineNumbers
function updateUI(): void {
  if (state === 'editing') {
    showIframe()
    const code = elements.editor.value
    const { iframeCode, sourceCode } = transpileCode(code)
    updateIframe(iframeCode)
    updateSource(sourceCode)
    return
  }

  if (state === 'error') {
    // ...
    return
  }

  throw new Error(`State ${state} should not be possible. 💥`)
}
```

Let's create the `transpileCode` function first, and explain how that works. Before we do that we have to install `@babel/standalone`, so we can use **Babel** client-side because we're not using a server.

```shell:terminal
npm i @babel/standalone
```

After you have done that we can import `transform` from `@babel/standalone`.

```ts:src/main.ts showLineNumbers
import { transform } from '@babel/standalone'
import { importsRegex, pureRegex, replace } from './utils/format'

import type { ErrorMessageType, StateType, TranspiledCodeType } from './types'

function transpileCode(code: string): TranspiledCodeType {
  // ignore imports so Babel doesn't transpile it
  const codeToTranspile = replace(code, importsRegex)
  // the magic sauce used to transpile the code
  const options = { presets: ['es2015-loose', 'react'] }
  const { code: transpiledCode } = transform(codeToTranspile, options)

  if (!transpiledCode) {
    // syntax errors get caught by the `error` listener
    throw new Error(`Something went wrong transpiling ${codeToTranspile}.`)
  }

  const hasImports = Boolean(code.match(importsRegex))
  const imports = code.match(importsRegex)?.join('\n') ?? ''

  return {
    // this is passed to `updateIframe`
    iframeCode: hasImports ? `${imports}\n${transpiledCode}` : transpiledCode,
    // this is passed to `updateSource`
    // ignore /*#__PURE__*/ from transpiled output to reduce noise
    sourceCode: replace(transpiledCode, pureRegex),
  }
}
```

Let's break down what's going on:

1. The `transpileCode` functions takes a `string` that's our input
2. Inside `codeToTranspile` we remove **imports**, for example `import React from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/react'` because **Babel** would **transpile** it
3. We set **Babel** options to use the **es2015-loose** (it transpiles **ES6** to **ES5** in a way that's more readable), and **react** preset so it understands **JSX**
4. We pass those parameters to **Babel** `transform`, and destructure `code` from the result that we rename to `transpiledCode`
5. If for some reason `transpiledCode` doesn't return anything, we raise an **error**
6. `hasImports` checks if there are **imports**, and `imports` find the **imports** that returns an **array** so we use `join` to return a **string** and separate each **import** by a new line, or set it to an **empty string** as fallback
7. In the return we set `iframeCode` to include `imports` and `transpiledCode` if there are **imports**, or just the **transpiledCode** if there are none
8. For `sourceCode` we replace `/*#__PURE__*/` **string** generated by **Babel** to make the output more readable

The `format.ts` utils is nothing special — just some **regex** to match **imports**, the **string** we want to remove, and a `replace` function to save on typing.

```ts:src/utils/format.ts showLineNumbers
export const importsRegex = /import(?:["'\s]*([\w*{}\n\r\t, ]+)from\s*)?["'\s].*([@\w/_-]+)["'\s].*/g
export const pureRegex = /\/\*#__PURE__\*\//g

export function replace(string: string, regex: RegExp, value = ''): string {
  return string.replace(regex, value).trim()
}
```

To learn about how **Babel** works I read the [Babel documentation](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/) and played around in their [REPL](https://babeljs.io/repl) to figure out what preset I wanted.

If you're following along I highly recommend you get the [Inline HTML](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pushqrdx.inline-html) extension for **VS Code** because it gives us **syntax highlight** and **code completion** for **template strings**. You can read [Syntax Highlight Inside ES6 Template Strings](https://joyofcode.xyz/template-strings-syntax-highlight) to learn how it's useful.

We need to create the `updateIframe`, and `updateSource` functions.

```ts:src/main.ts showLineNumbers
function updateIframe(code: string): void {
  const source = /* html */ `
    <html>
    <head>
      <link rel="stylesheet" href="/iframe.css">
    </head>
    <body>
      <div id="app"></div>
      <script type="module">${code}</script>
    </body>
    </html>
  `
  elements.iframe.srcdoc = source
}
```

Don't forget we have to invoke `updateUI` to render the **user interface**. If you're coding along temporarily comment out `updateSource` to see the result.

```ts:src/main.ts
updateUI()
```

{% img src="iframe.webp" alt="Iframe" %}

In `updateFrame` we just create a **template string** and replace the [srcdoc](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe#attr-srcdoc) which is the entire **HTML document** of the `<iframe>` each update. The **CSS** is linked from the **public** folder because **Vite** uses it for **static assets**, so we can access it even when deployed. It has an id attribute of **app** like most frameworks use. The **code** is inside `<script>` that's a **module**, so we can use [ES modules](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/03/es-modules-a-cartoon-deep-dive/). Using **module** we also don't have to use **defer**, so the script executes after the **DOM** has loaded.

```ts:src/main.ts showLineNumbers
function updateSource(transpiledOutput: string): void {
  const sourceHTML = /* html */ `
    <h3>📜 Source</h3>
    <xmp>${transpiledOutput}</xmp>
  `
  elements.source.innerHTML = sourceHTML
}
```

{% img src="source.webp" alt="Source" %}

For `updateSource` we just set the `innerHTML` for `source`. The only interesting thing here is the `<xmp>` element that's like the `<pre>` element but doesn't interpret **HTML**. This isn't ideal because it's deprecated, but it's a great solution because we don't have to think about escaping the **HTML** characters. You can reach for a package that does that, or write your own solution.

## Showing Errors

We already set up the **event listener** earlier to listen for **errors**, so the only thing left to do is to update the `updateUI` function.

```ts:src/main.ts showLineNumbers
function updateUI(): void {
  // ...

  if (state === 'error') {
    showError()
    logError(errorMessage)
    return
  }

  throw new Error(`State ${state} should not be possible. 💥`)
}
```

`logError` is going to look exactly like `updateSource`.

```ts:src/main.ts showLineNumbers
function logError(error: string): void {
  const errorHtml = /* html */ `
    <h3>💩 Error</h3>
    <xmp>${error}</xmp>
  `
  elements.errors.innerHTML = errorHtml
}
```

{% img src="error.webp" alt="Error" %}

That's it for the **code sandbox** part. It's not that complicated. 😄

## Using the Monaco Editor

Integrating the **Monaco Editor** might be simpler than you think.

We're going to use [vite-plugin-monaco-editor](https://github.com/vdesjs/vite-plugin-monaco-editor) that uses [monaco-editor](https://github.com/Microsoft/monaco-editor) but makes it easier because we have to write less code like defining **service workers**, and it uses [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) for quick builds.

There's around **800 modules** if we use the entire **Monaco Editor** library, so that's a lot to go through using just a **JavaScript** bundler. **esbuild** is a **JavaScript bundler** written in [Go](https://golang.org/) which is a lot faster at those types of tasks.

Inside the [Monaco Editor GitHub repository](https://github.com/microsoft/monaco-editor) there are examples of how to integrate it using different methods. We're only interested in [Integrate the ESM version](https://github.com/microsoft/monaco-editor/blob/main/docs/integrate-esm.md) that has steps for **Webpack**, **Parcel**, and **Vite**. If you look at [Using Vite](https://github.com/microsoft/monaco-editor/blob/main/docs/integrate-esm.md#using-vite) you can see it's nothing complicated, but using the plugin is even simpler.

If you're interested in even more examples of using the **Monaco Editor** such as using **Electron**, there's a [monaco-editor-samples](https://github.com/microsoft/monaco-editor-samples) repository.

Let's replace the `<textarea>` inside `index.html`.

```html:index.html showLineNumbers
<section class="code">
  <div class="editor" data-editor></div>
</section>
```

Your `package.json` should already include `vite-plugin-monaco-editor` as a **development dependency**, but you can always install it with `npm i -D vite-plugin-monaco-editor`.

To use the **plugin** we have to update the **Vite** config in the root of your project, so create it.

```ts:vite.config.ts showLineNumbers
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import monacoEditorPlugin from 'vite-plugin-monaco-editor'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    monacoEditorPlugin({
      languageWorkers: ['editorWorkerService', 'typescript'],
    }),
  ],
})
```

In the final version I'm reducing the bundle size by only importing features we're using. The only **service workers** we need is for the **editor**, and **TypeScript**. You have to include **TypeScript**, because it shares the same **service worker** with **JavaScript**. You can always read the documentation to learn more.

**Service workers** let you do tasks in the background (it's like using multiple threads), so it doesn't freeze the **user interface**. **Monaco Editor** uses **service workers** for all features of the **editor**.

Inside `lib/monaco/` we're going to add `monacoEditor.ts`.

```ts:src/lib/monaco/monacoEditor.ts showLineNumbers
import * as monaco from 'monaco-editor/esm/vs/editor/editor.api'
import 'monaco-editor/esm/vs/editor/contrib/inlineCompletions/ghostTextController.js'
import 'monaco-editor/esm/vs/basic-languages/javascript/javascript.contribution'
import 'monaco-editor/esm/vs/language/typescript/monaco.contribution'

import { elements } from '../../utils/dom'

const editorCode = /* html */ `
import React, { useEffect } from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/react'
import { render } from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/react-dom'

import confetti from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/canvas-confetti'

function App() {
  useEffect(() => confetti(), [])

  return (
    <div className="app">
      <h1>JavaScript Sandbox</h1>
      <p>
        You can use NPM packages provided by {''}
        <a href="https://www.skypack.dev/">Skypack</a>.
      </p>
      <img src="/image.gif" />
    </div>
  )
}

render(
  <App />,
  document.getElementById('app')
)`.trim()

const editorOptions = {
  value: editorCode,
  language: 'javascript',
  theme: 'vs-dark',
  automaticLayout: true,
  minimap: {
    enabled: false,
  },
  fontFamily: 'IBM Plex Mono, monospace',
  fontSize: 16,
  tabSize: 2,
}

const monacoEditor = monaco.editor.create(elements.editor, editorOptions)
export { monacoEditor as default }
```

We're doing the same here by only importing features we're using such as **code completion**, **JavaScript** support, and again we have to include **TypeScript** also.

I figured this out through trial and error by spelunking inside **node_modules** because I already knew you could import only what you require from the plugin documentation.

If you don't care about this, you can just say `import * as monaco from 'monaco-editor'`. The `import * as monaco` part is because there's no **default export**, the **Monaco Editor** just imports a bunch of things we can use.

We're using **React** code as the default example to show **Babel**, and **ES modules** working. You could try any other **JavaScript** framework such as **Vue** if it can work with **ES modules**. I even managed to make **Svelte** work (without single file components since there's no compiler).

Inside **editorOptions** we can set the **language**, and **theme** among other things. [automaticLayout](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/api/interfaces/monaco.editor.ieditoroptions.html#automaticlayout) checks if the **editor** is resized to adjust the size.

You can read the [Monaco Editor API](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/api/index.html) to learn what's possible but it might take you a while to figure things out through search and asking questions since it's confusing.

Lastly we create the **Monaco Editor**, and **export** it as `monacoEditor` that has a `getValue` method to get the contents.

```ts:src/main.ts showLineNumbers
import monacoEditor from './lib/monaco/monacoEditor'

function updateUI(): void {
  if (state === 'editing') {
    // ...
    const code = monacoEditor.getValue()
    // ...
  }

  // ...
}

```

Congratulations! 🥳

## Conclusion

Hope you learned something, and changed the code to work how you want. Here's what you can do next if you're interested:

- Let the user enter **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** like **CodePen**
- Have the ability to use multiple files (you can look up how it's done using the **Monaco Editor**)
- **Persist code** by using [local storage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) (save the input to **local storage**, and check if it exists on **page load** to set the contents of the **editor**)
- Use a framework

Thanks for reading! 🏄‍♀️
