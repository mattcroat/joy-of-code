# Learn How SvelteKit Works As a Framework

## Futuristic Web Development

I started web development at the height of the React era when single page applications were all the rage and that meant we had to recreate what browsers already knew how to do from navigation to handling forms in JavaScript to support those types of applications.

As time moved on progressive enhancement was pushed to the side and instead of using JavaScript to enhance the user experience it started being required.

{% img src="twitter.webp" alt="Twitter with JavaScript disabled" %}

If you disable JavaScript on Twitter it doesn't work because it's a single page application that uses React.

Things are starting to change and we're seeing a shift to the server because we realized despite having a computer in our pocket we shouldn't do everything in the client because it's a worse user experience because of the bundle size and having your entire logic in one place JavaScript can fail for whatever reason.

Let me explain some important concepts briefly:

- **SSR** (server-side rendering) is the process of taking a request from the browser and returning a rendered version of the page as a HTML document as a response which is great for **SEO** (search engine optimization) because it's easy to index by crawlers
- **CSR** (client-side rendering) is the opposite where you send the browser an empty HTML document and let JavaScript handle the rendering for all the content inside it and is great for applications but not for **SEO**
- **SSG** (static site generation) is similar to **SSR** but instead of building a page on demand when you visit a page you **prerender** the pages in advance you can cache forever and it's great for **SEO** but you have to do it each time when you make a change
- **SPA** (single page application) is a general term used to describe an app that doesn't need to reload when you change a route and is contained within one page where JavaScript handles everything using **CSR**
- **MPA** (multi page application) is the opposite of a **SPA** where every page you navigate has to refresh the page — think of an eCommerce store because using **SSR** to load a HTML document is faster than having to wait for a **SPA** to load JavaScript

SvelteKit is a full stack framework that gives you the best of both worlds where the page is **server-side rendered** on your first visit but when you navigate to other pages they're going to be **client-side rendered**.

SvelteKit gives you levers for your pages to use any of these [rendering methods](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/appendix).

> The core of SvelteKit provides a highly configurable rendering engine.

Because SvelteKit blurs the line between frontend and backend it might be confusing where your code runs and that's what I'm going to try to answer.

This post assumes you're at least familiar with SvelteKit but if you're not I have an entire [SvelteKit For Beginners](https://joyofcode.xyz/sveltekit-for-beginners) series and [Svelte For Beginners](https://joyofcode.xyz/svelte-for-beginners) series you can watch.

## SvelteKit Is A Backend Framework

**Kit** isn't built on top of **Svelte** but it's a **backend web framework** where Svelte is used as the view layer but in theory you could rip it out and replace it with another component framework that supports server-side rendering and the same is true for other web frameworks.

It helps If you're familiar with [HTTP request methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods) and have prior experience with backend frameworks like [Express](<[https://expressjs.com/](https://expressjs.com/)>) but it's not required and you can think of SvelteKit as a replacement because **you don't need a separate backend** — SvelteKit is where you write your frontend and backend logic.

![https://c.tenor.com/1wJU51jgwSQAAAAC/dbz-dragonball.gif](https://c.tenor.com/1wJU51jgwSQAAAAC/dbz-dragonball.gif)

Here's an example of a [REST API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) endpoint in Express.

```js:example showLineNumbers
import express from 'express'

const app = express()

// GET HTTP method
app.get('/', (request, response) => {
  response.json({ message: 'Hello' })
})

// your frontend app would be at http://localhost:3000/
// where you can consume the JSON response from the API
app.listen(4000)
```

This is the SvelteKit equivalent and they work the same and return a `application/json` content type response header that returns `JSON` data from the API.

```js:example showLineNumbers
// you can expose and use this endpoint anywhere
export async function GET({ request }) {
	return {
		body: { message: 'Hello' }
	}
}
```

Because SvelteKit is the frontend and backend you can deploy everything as a [Node server](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/adapter-node) or use [Vercel](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/adapter-vercel) and serverless functions.

You can keep your server separate if you want and it might not be a great idea for making something like [Discord](https://discordapp.com/) but if you need some real-time communication using [WebSockets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSocket) you can create a custom server and I have a post on [Using WebSockets With SvelteKit](https://joyofcode.xyz/using-websockets-with-sveltekit).

Among other things SvelteKit also includes:

- **Pages** (file based routing)
- **Endpoints** (API routes)
- **Nested layouts** (way more powerful than just nesting files because the segment of the URL maps to your component hierarchy)
- **Hot module replacement** (instant updates in the browser when you make a change preserving application state)
- **Preprocessing** (TypeScript, SCSS and Pug among others)
- **Building component libraries** (creating and publishing npm packages)
- **Deployment options** (adapters for any platform)

## SvelteKit Uses The Web Platform

SvelteKit is a machine that takes your code as input and outputs code as you make a change and you can find the generated server and client code in the `.svelte-kit` folder.

My favorite quote that describes SvelteKit comes from the [documentation](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/web-standards).

> Fundamentally, a SvelteKit app is a machine for turning a Request into a Response.

SvelteKit leverages the web platform and uses the regular [Request](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request) and [Response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response) objects of the [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) so it works in any JavaScript runtime that's not a browser and uses [adapters](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) to output the code for the deployment target.

Here's an example of a simple Request object and fetching the data.

```js:example showLineNumbers
const request = new Request('https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon', {
  method: 'GET',
  headers: { 'content-type': 'application/json' }
})

console.log(request)

/*
	Request {
	  method: 'GET',
	  headers: { 'content-type': 'application/json' }
		// ...
	}
*/

fetch(request)
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(response => console.log(response.results))
```

You would see the same request in SvelteKit.

```js:example showLineNumbers
export async function GET({ request }) {
	const response = await fetch('https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon')
	const pokemon = await response.json()

	console.log(request)

	/*
		Request {
	  	method: 'GET',
	  	headers: { 'content-type': 'application/json'  }
			// ...
		}
	*/

	return {
		body: pokemon.results,
	}
}
```

## Set Up SvelteKit From Scratch

It only takes a couple of steps and is going to help you understand how SvelteKit works and the difference between server-side rendering and client-side rendering and where your code runs.

Inside an empty folder create a handcrafted 💪 `package.json` file and specify we're using [ECMAScript modules](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html#modules-ecmascript-modules) which is the official format to package JavaScript code for reuse and include the scripts to run it.

```json:package.json showLineNumbers
{
  "type": "module",
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite dev",
    "build": "vite build",
    "preview": "vite preview"
  }
}
```

Next we have to install Kit, Svelte and Vite as a development dependency.

```shell:terminal
npm i -D @sveltejs/kit svelte vite
```

It's namespaced under the same [sveltejs](https://github.com/sveltejs) organization on GitHub.

The `svelte-kit` and `vite` binaries are under `node_modules/.bin` that get executed when you run the development server and if you open the file it's just a script that points to the entry point of your app.

These files are required for SvelteKit to work:

- Add a `vite.config.js` file
- Add a `svelte.config.js` file
- Create a `src` folder
  - Add a `src/app.html` file
  - Create a `src/routes` folder
    - Add a `routes/index.svelte` file

```js:vite.config.js showLineNumbers
// you can add plugins and change config options

import { sveltekit } from '@sveltejs/kit/vite'

/** @type {import('vite').UserConfig} */
const config = {
	plugins: [sveltekit()],
}

export default config

```

```js:svelte.config.js showLineNumbers
// you can add preprocessors and adapters here

/** @type {import('@sveltejs/kit').Config} */
const config = {
	kit: {},
}

export default config
```

```html:app.html showLineNumbers
<head>
  %sveltekit.head%
</head>

<body>
  %sveltekit.body%
</body>
```

```html:index.svelte showLineNumbers
<h1>Home</h1>
```

After you run the `npm run dev` command the SvelteKit CLI loads the Svelte config and starts the Vite development server and outputs the welcome message in your terminal.

```shell:terminal
  vite dev server running at:

  > Local: http://localhost:3000/
  > Network: use `--host` to expose
```

That's everything you need to set up a basic SvelteKit project. 😎

I'm always amazed how the browser is smart enough to construct a proper HTML page even after the crime we've done.

If you run a build it's going to use Node by default but it's going to be different based on what adapter you use — preconfigured SvelteKit projects use `@sveltejs/adapter-auto` that detects your production environment and uses the appropriate adapter.

The SvelteKit project is a monorepo meaning instead of having every package in a separate repository on GitHub it can be in one place instead making it easier to maintain and contribute to.

If you look at [packages](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages) in the SvelteKit repository you can find:

- `adapters` for different platforms
- `create-svelte` which is the CLI for creating SvelteKit projects
- `kit` being the SvelteKit framework and CLI

## Let's Examine The Generated Output

SvelteKit takes your app as the input and creates the output.

When you start the development server SvelteKit generates a `.svelte-kit` folder that contains a couple of folders:

- generated
  - `client-manifest.js` regenerates paths
  - `client-matchers.js` regenerates page matchers
  - `root.svelte` is the entry point that
- runtime (client and server code copied from `node_modules/@sveltejs/kit/assets`
- types (generated for each route)

The `root.svelte` file is interesting because it takes the routes from `client-manifest.js` that are treated as components and besides initializing some page values it's in charge of displaying the components.

```js:client-manifest.js showLineNumbers
// regenerated when you change pages
export const components = [
	// layout is at index 0
	() => import("../runtime/components/layout.svelte"),
	// error is at index 1 (ignored if page has no error)
	() => import("../runtime/components/error.svelte"),
	// home page is at index 1 (ignored if page has an error)
	() => import("../../src/routes/index.svelte")
]

// used to map components for the page and check if
// the page has a page endpoint but I'm not sure 😆
export const dictionary = {
	"": [[0, 2], [1]]
}
```

If you logged the values of the components inside `root.svelte` you would get an array of [Proxy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy) objects that represent components `[Proxy<Layout>, Proxy<Index>]` which are `[0, 1]` indexed.

The code is going to be generated based on your pages and the pyramid shape is going to be deeper based on how many named layouts you have but I simplified the code so it's easier to understand.

```js:root.svelte showLineNumbers
{#if components[1]}
	<svelte:component this={components[0]}>
		{#if components[2]}
			<svelte:component this={components[1]}>
				<svelte:component this={components[2]} />
			</svelte:component>
		{:else}
			<svelte:component this={components[1]} />
		{/if}
	</svelte:component>
{:else}
	<svelte:component this={components[0]} />
{/if}
```

Here's what's going on.

```shell:example
if page
	layout
		if page inside named layout
			named layout
				page
			named layout
    else
     page
    /if
	layout
else
	layout
/if
```

A simple way to see what is generated is to git commit the `.svelte-kit` folder and comparing the difference after making a change.

Here's an example of the the client manifest before and after adding a route.

```js:client-manifest.js {5,10} showLineNumbers
export const components = [
  () => import('../runtime/components/layout.svelte'),
  () => import('../runtime/components/error.svelte'),
  () => import('../../src/routes/index.svelte'),
  () => import('../../src/routes/some/nested/route/index.svelte'),
]

export const dictionary = {
  '': [[0, 2], [1]],
  'some/nested/route': [[0, 3], [1]],
}
```

## The Heart Of SvelteKit

At the heart of SvelteKit is a client-side router that handles everything from intercepting links, handling file-based routing, nested layouts, providing page and navigation stores and watching file changes to regenerate routes but what makes SvelteKit work is [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) as it's built on top of it.

Vite is a next generation build tool made by the Vue creator [Evan You](https://twitter.com/youyuxi) and you can think of it as a replacement for bundlers like [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) and it enables:

- **The development server**
- **Server-side rendering**
- **Watching files for changes** (regenerating routes when adding a page)
- **Hot module replacement** (updates your page when you make a change)
- **Unbundled development** (using ES modules)
- **Optimized builds** (using Rollup)

If you could zoom out and see a visual representation of what makes SvelteKit you would see something like this I consider to be the most relevant.

{% img src="sveltekit.webp" alt="SvelteKit diagram" %}

- **Vite** (development server, file watcher, bundler)
- **Adapters** (plugins that generate output for target platforms)
- **Sade** (smooth CLI operator 🎤)
- **Chokidar** (file watcher also used by Vite)
- **Svelte** (view layer)

If this was a crime show this would be the part where you say “enhance” so let's do that for Kit and see what makes it work.

{% img src="kit.webp" alt="Kit diagram" %}

- **Vite plugins** `vite-plugin-svelte` and `vite-plugin-svelte-kit`
- **Node** that includes polyfills for the Fetch API using `node-fetch` and makes web APIs available as globals
- **Core** is the build-time and CLI code
- **Runtime** is the client and server code
- **Packaging** is the code for creating and publishing packages

These parts together make Svexodia.

![https://i.imgur.com/WbqIG7F.gif](https://i.imgur.com/WbqIG7F.gif)

You can see [vite-plugin-svelte](https://github.com/sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte) is used to make Svelte work with Vite and pass it plugin options from compiler options, preprocessors to the [inspector](https://github.com/sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte/blob/main/docs/config.md#inspector) that shows you where the element under your cursor is located and open it in your code editor.

The `vite-plugin-svelte-kit` is interesting because it's imported from `@sveltejs/kit/vite` as `sveltekit` and it's responsible for taking the SvelteKit config, creating routes, server-side rendering and loading the template replacing the `%sveltekit%` placeholders inside `app.html` among other things.

It exports the plugins that are used inside `kit/dist/cli.js` that returns us to the starting point after you ran `npm run dev`.

Hope I didn't lose you! 😄

If you're confused that's alright because I'm right besides you trying to understand how it works.

Now that you have a higher level understanding of how SvelteKit works let's explore how client-side rendering and server-side rendering works.

## Client-Side Rendering

You might have to process a lot of data or want to use [GraphQL](https://bundlephobia.com/package/graphql@16.5.0) (it's larger than React 😱) on the client but you're making the user pay for the compute and bandwidth when the server should do the hard work.

I created an endpoint inside `routes/api/pokemon.json.js` that uses the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) and returns a list of Pokemon.

```js:pokemon.json.js showLineNumbers
// server API endpoint
export async function GET() {
	const response = await fetch('https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon')
	const pokemon = await response.json()

	return {
		body: pokemon.results,
	}
}
```

This shows the benefit of having a backend because you can cherry-pick data you want before you pass it back to the client without the user having to pay the cost.

You might be used to doing something like this in a traditional single page application regardless where you fetch the data from.

```html:index.svelte showLineNumbers
<script>
	// client-side rendered
	async function getPokemon() {
		const response = await fetch('/api/pokemon.json')
		return response.json()
	}
</script>

<h1>Pokemon</h1>

{#await getPokemon()}
	<p>Loading...</p>
{:then pokemon}
	{#each pokemon as pokemon}
		<li>{pokemon.name}</li>
	{/each}
{/await}

<style>
	li {
		text-transform: capitalize;
	}
</style>
```

If you load the page you should see a brief `Loading...` indicator before fetching and loading the Pokemon data.

I want to make a site that shows every Pokemon and is easily indexed by a search engine, so it shows up in search results to drive traffic to make those sweet Pokemon dollars.

Easy enough, right?

There's one problem when I go and **view page source**.

```html:source showLineNumbers
<head>
	<style data-sveltekit>
		li.s-Uap-jPRb-uiE {
			text-transform: capitalize;
		}
	</style>
</head>

<body>
	<h1 class="s-Uap-jPRb-uiE">Pokemon</h1>
	<!-- Dude, where's my markup? -->
	<p class="s-Uap-jPRb-uiE">Loading...</p>
	<!-- ... -->
</body>
```

If you look at the **network** tab when the page loads it's going to fetch [`http://localhost:3000/api/pokemon.json`](http://localhost:3000/api/pokemon.json) and return a `200 OK` response with the JSON data that JavaScript is going to use to loop over the list of Pokemon and show it on the page.

This should be expected because we're not using server-side rendering (don't confuse the API endpoint we made for server-side rendering) but doing the data fetching on the client and using client-side rendering.

{% img src="csr.webp" alt="Client-side rendering diagram" %}

Client-side rendering is less resilient because JavaScript can fail for whatever reason but it also has the downside of making the round-trip to get the data.

[Google says it can crawl sites with JavaScript](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/javascript/javascript-seo-basics) but it's not cheap to do because you have to open the page in a headless browser and execute JavaScript for millions of sites compared to looking at a HTML page and indexing it, so you're going to get penalized if you want great SEO.

> Once Googlebot's resources **allow**, a headless Chromium renders the page and executes the JavaScript.

## Server-Side Rendering

Server-side rendering has improved performance because everything loads when it's ready even if you have to wait for it compared to showing a loading spinner and content loading after causing layout shifts.

To server-side render the Pokemon data we need to fetch the Pokemon on the server instead of the client.

You've probably done it before.

```html:index.svelte showLineNumbers
<script context="module">
	// server-side rendered
	export async function load({ fetch }) {
		const response = await fetch('api/pokemon.json')

		return {
			props: {
				pokemon: await response.json(),
			},
		}
	}
</script>

<script>
	export let pokemon
</script>

<h1>Pokemon</h1>

<ul>
	{#each pokemon as pokemon}
		<li>{pokemon.name}</li>
	{/each}
</ul>

<style>
	li {
		text-transform: capitalize;
	}
</style>
```

A page can export a `load` function inside the module context script that runs before the component is created and it runs during server-side rendering and in the client.

If your page depends on data that's only used for that page you can reduce boilerplate if you use [page endpoints](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/routing#endpoints-page-endpoints).

Here's a brief aside If you don't know how module context works because it's useful outside SvelteKit.

In Svelte every component is an instance.

```js:example showLineNumbers
// this file is a module

console.log('context module')

export class Component {
	constructor() {
		console.log('component')
	}
}
```

```js:example showLineNumbers
import { Component } from './Component.js'

// logs "context module" once

const component1 = new Component() // logs "component"
const component2 = new Component() // logs "component" again
```

The `context module` part is what happens in `<script context="module">` and `component` is what happens inside the `<script>` tag.

If you remember our diagram for Kit showed how the `node` package makes web APIs available as globals including `node-fetch` and you might have noticed we're using the `window.fetch` method inside `load` that SvelteKit provides because the Fetch API wasn't supported in Node until recently.

This wasn't the case for `api/pokemon.json` because that only runs on the server but the page is going to run on the server and the client and it would throw an error.

Long story short **—** everything happens on the server.

If you open the page it's going to be server-side rendered meaning if you look at the HTML document that the server responds with you're going to see the data.

```html:source showLineNumbers
<head>
	<style data-sveltekit>
		li.s-Uap-jPRb-uiE {
			text-transform: capitalize;
		}
	</style>
</head>

<body>
	<h1 class="s-Uap-jPRb-uiE">Pokemon</h1>

	<ul class="s-Uap-jPRb-uiE">
		<li class="s-Uap-jPRb-uiE">bulbasaur</li>
		<li class="s-Uap-jPRb-uiE">ivysaur</li>
		<li class="s-Uap-jPRb-uiE">venusaur</li>
		<li class="s-Uap-jPRb-uiE">charmander</li>
		<li class="s-Uap-jPRb-uiE">charmeleon</li>
		<li class="s-Uap-jPRb-uiE">charizard</li>
		<li class="s-Uap-jPRb-uiE">squirtle</li>
		<li class="s-Uap-jPRb-uiE">wartortle</li>
		<li class="s-Uap-jPRb-uiE">blastoise</li>
		<li class="s-Uap-jPRb-uiE">caterpie</li>
		<li class="s-Uap-jPRb-uiE">metapod</li>
		<li class="s-Uap-jPRb-uiE">butterfree</li>
		<li class="s-Uap-jPRb-uiE">weedle</li>
		<li class="s-Uap-jPRb-uiE">kakuna</li>
		<li class="s-Uap-jPRb-uiE">beedrill</li>
		<li class="s-Uap-jPRb-uiE">pidgey</li>
		<li class="s-Uap-jPRb-uiE">pidgeotto</li>
		<li class="s-Uap-jPRb-uiE">pidgeot</li>
		<li class="s-Uap-jPRb-uiE">rattata</li>
		<li class="s-Uap-jPRb-uiE">raticate</li>
	</ul>

	<!-- ... -->
</body>
```

Instead of doing a round-trip when using client-side rendering before we use server-side rendering to get everything from the server and show it to the user.

{% img src="ssr.webp" alt="Server-side rendering diagram" %}

Another interesting aside is what SvelteKit does with the `fetch` response:

- During server-side rendering the response will be captured and inlined into the rendered HTML
- During hydration the response will be read from the HTML preventing an additional network request

```html:source showLineNumbers
<!-- ... -->

<script
	type="application/json"
	sveltekit:data-type="data"
	sveltekit:data-url="api/pokemon.json"
>
	{
		"status": 200,
		"statusText": "",
		"headers": { "content-type": "application/json; charset=utf-8" },
		"body": "..."
	}
</script>
```

I'm going to explain hydration later.

## Client-Side Navigation

As I previously mentioned when you load a page for the first time it's going to use server-side rendering but after the client gets initialized subsequent navigations use client-side navigation but you can still view the page source.

```html:index.svelte showLineNumbers
<a href="/pikachu">Pikachu</a>
```

You might want to have a special page for every Pokemon so I created `[pokemon].svelte` as an example route that doesn't do anything.

```html:[pokemon].svelte showLineNumbers
<a href="/">Home</a>
```

Open your **network** tab and check the “**disable cache**” checkbox.

If you navigate from `/` to `/pikachu` you can see a `GET` request to [http://localhost:3000/src/routes/[pokemon].svelte](http://localhost:3000/src/routes/%5Bpokemon%5D.svelte) that returns a server-side rendered Svelte component that hydrates the page if you look at the **preview** tab.

If you navigate from `/pokemon` back to `/` you can see a `GET` request for [http://localhost:3000/api/pokemon.json](http://localhost:3000/api/pokemon.json) and if that was a page endpoint it would be `__data.json`.

{% img src="navigation.webp" alt="Page navigation diagram" %}

When you load a page the favicon in your browser tab spins indicating the page is loading but if you look at it during navigation you're going to notice it doesn't indicating client-side navigation.

Since the client is loaded SvelteKit can intercept the requests and bypass the normal browser navigation unless you refresh the page or load it from the URL because SvelteKit has to rebuild everything.

You can add the global `browser.router` config option or add [page options](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/page-options) to disable client-side router and even use [sveltekit:reload](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/a-options#sveltekit-reload) on links that's going to cause the browser to do a full page reload to see how it works.

## Hydration

When a user requests a page the server sends a “dry” HTML page where the components are rendered as HTML but to make the page interactive with JavaScript hydration is used to load the JavaScript and make the page interactable.

{% img src="hydration.webp" alt="Hydration diagram" %}

Hydration sounds like a fancy term but it just means adding JavaScript back to your server-side rendered HTML page.

![https://c.tenor.com/dm2vFChLCtUAAAAC/back-to.gif](https://c.tenor.com/dm2vFChLCtUAAAAC/back-to.gif)

If you want to learn more [@lihautan](https://twitter.com/lihautan) has a great [video explaining how hydration works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D46aT3mx9LU).

This is important to understand because your page runs both on the server and client — first the page has to be server-side rendered on the server and sent back as HTML so you have to re-render it on the client to hydrate the page.

Because of this if you try to talk to a database inside the `load` function you're going to realize it doesn't work without using an endpoint because `load` runs on the server and client while an endpoint only runs on the server.

You can try it out yourself if you log `console.log('Hello')` which is going to output `Hello` on the server (your terminal) and client (browser console).

Knowing this makes reading the warning from the SvelteKit documentation for [loading](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/loading) start to make a lot more sense:

- Use the SvelteKit provided fetch wrapper rather than using the native fetch **(because it runs on the server and you need to fetch the data to server-side render it)**
- Don't reference window, document, or any browser-specific objects **(because it runs on the server where those don't exist)**
- Don't directly reference any API keys or secrets, which will be exposed to the client, but instead call an endpoint that uses any required secrets **(because the page gets server-side rendered and then it needs to re-render on the client because of hydration)**

Let's look at an example of how this works.

```html:counter.svelte showLineNumbers
<script>
	let count = 0
</script>

<button on:click={() => count += 1}>
	{count}
</button>
```

You can use the [Svelte REPL](https://svelte.dev/repl/hello-world) to see the compiled output.

Since we're using server-side rendering we need to turn the component into a string and return it as HTML and that's what the Svelte compiler does if you pass it **SSR** as an option.

```js:REPL showLineNumbers
import { create_ssr_component, escape } from 'svelte/internal'

const App = create_ssr_component(
  ($$result, $$props, $$bindings, slots) => {
  	let count = 0
    return `<button>${escape(count)}</button>`
  }
)
```

This is used for server-side rendering to return the component as HTML and that's why you need hydration.

How does Svelte know what elements it needs to hydrate?

This is where the **hydratable** option comes into play and if you switch back the generate option to **DOM** for the compiler you can see the compiled Svelte code.

I simplified the code so we can focus on the interesting part.

```js:REPL showLineNumbers
function create_fragment(ctx) {
	let button
	let t

	return {
		c() {
			button = element('button')
			t = text(/*count*/ ctx[0])
		},
		l(nodes) {
			button = claim_element(nodes, 'BUTTON', {})
			var button_nodes = children(button)
			t = claim_text(button_nodes, /*count*/ ctx[0])
			button_nodes.forEach(detach)
		},
		m(target, anchor) {
			insert_hydration(target, button, anchor)
			append_hydration(button, t)
		}
	}
}
```

This takes care of creating, claiming and mounting the elements.

I made the same component in SvelteKit and this is the response from `count.svelte` in the **network** tab after I cleaned it up.

<details>
	<summary>counter.svelte</summary>

```js:count.svelte showLineNumbers
// imports

const file = 'src/routes/counter.svelte'

function create_fragment(ctx) {
	let button
	let t
	let mounted
	let dispose

	const block = {
		c: function create() {
			button = element('button')
			t = text(/*count*/ ctx[0])
			this.h()
		},
		l: function claim(nodes) {
			button = claim_element(nodes, 'BUTTON', {})
			var button_nodes = children(button)
			t = claim_text(button_nodes, /*count*/ ctx[0])
			button_nodes.forEach(detach_dev)
			this.h()
		},
		h: function hydrate() {
			add_location(button, file, 8, 0, 99)
		},
		m: function mount(target, anchor) {
			insert_hydration_dev(target, button, anchor)
			append_hydration_dev(button, t)

			if (!mounted) {
				dispose = listen_dev(
					button,
					'click',
					/*click_handler*/ ctx[1],
					false,
					false,
					false
				)
				mounted = true
			}
		},
		p: function update(ctx, [dirty]) {
			if (dirty & /*count*/ 1) set_data_dev(t, /*count*/ ctx[0])
		},
		i: noop,
		o: noop,
		d: function destroy(detaching) {
			if (detaching) detach_dev(button)
			mounted = false
			dispose()
		},
	}

	return block
}

let hydrate = true

function instance($$self, $$props, $$invalidate) {
	let { $$slots: slots = {}, $$scope } = $$props
	validate_slots('Counter', slots, [])
	let count = 0

	const click_handler = () => $$invalidate(0, (count += 1))
	$$self.$capture_state = () => ({ hydrate, count })

	$$self.$inject_state = ($$props) => {
		if ('count' in $$props) $$invalidate(0, (count = $$props.count))
	}

	if ($$props && '$$inject' in $$props) {
		$$self.$inject_state($$props.$$inject)
	}

	return [count, click_handler]
}

class Counter extends SvelteComponentDev {
	constructor(options) {
		super(options)
		init(this, options, instance, create_fragment, safe_not_equal, {})
	}
}

export default Counter

export { hydrate }
```

</details>

It's not that hard to read to at least get an idea of what's going on and it looks similar to the code from the Svelte REPL — if you look at the `instance` function you can see the `click_handler` code for our counter.

If you **view page source** you can see the hydrate script added by SvelteKit.

```html:source showLineNumbers
<body>
	<button>0</button>

	<script type="module" data-sveltekit-hydrate="ocsxhs">
		import { start } from '/@fs/home/matia/dev/sveltekit-explained/.svelte-kit/runtime/client/start.js'
		start({
			target: document.querySelector('[data-sveltekit-hydrate="ocsxhs"]')
				.parentNode,
			paths: { base: '', assets: '' },
			session: {},
			route: true,
			spa: false,
			trailing_slash: 'never',
			hydrate: {
				status: 200,
				error: null,
				nodes: [0, 2],
				params: {},
				routeId: 'counter',
			},
		})
	</script>
</body>
```

If you go to the **sources tab** in your developer tools inside `counter.svelte` and put a breakpoint on the line that invokes the `start` function you can step through it if you're adventurous.

{% img src="debugger.webp" alt="Debugger" %}

This is where the magic happens inside `.svelte-kit/runtime/client/start.js`.

```js:start.js showLineNumbers
async function start({
	paths, target, session, route, spa, trailing_slash, hydrate
}) {
	// Create client
	const client = create_client({
		target,
		session,
		base: paths.base,
		trailing_slash
	});

	// initialize client
	init({ client })
	set_paths(paths)

	// hydration
	if (hydrate) {
		await client._hydrate(hydrate)
	}

	// routing
	if (route) {
		if (spa) client.goto(location.href, { replaceState: true })
		client._start_router()
	}

	// used for testing I think 🤷
	dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('sveltekit:start'))
}
```

If you step into the `_hydrate` function you can see how SvelteKit loads the JavaScript modules required for the page from the manifest.

```js:start.js showLineNumbers
_hydrate: async ({ status, error, nodes, params, routeId }) => {
	// ...

	// loops through nodes from the hydrate object
	for (let i = 0; i < nodes.length; i += 1) {
		const node = await load_node({
			// nodes: [0, 2] from client-manifest.js
			// 0: Proxy<Layout>
			// 2: Proxy<Counter>
			module: await components[nodes[i]](),
			// ...
		})
	}

	// ...
}
```

Server-side rendering is a hard problem because you need to make sure what you have on the server and client matches and I'm grateful I don't have to think about it.

## Adapters

If you don't specify an adapter or use `adapter-auto` SvelteKit is going to output for Node if it can't detect a supported production environment.

I'm going to install `adapter-node` and import it inside `svelte.config.js`.

```shell:terminal
npm i -D @sveltejs/adapter-node
```

You can enable source maps for the build output if you want to debug the production build and disable minification to be able to look at the code.

```js:vite.config.js {6-9} showLineNumbers
import { sveltekit } from '@sveltejs/kit/vite'

/** @type {import('vite').UserConfig} */
const config = {
	plugins: [sveltekit()],
	build: {
		sourcemap: false,
		minify: false,
	},
}

export default config
```

After you run `npm run build` it's going to generate a `build` and `output` folder inside `.svelte-kit` for `npm run preview` but what you deploy is generated at the root of your project inside the `build` folder.

```shell:terminal
.
├── client
│   └── _app
│       ├── immutable
│       │   ├── assets

└── shims.js
```

You're going to see the file names include a unique hash like `index.svelte-f58f5bb5.css` to bust the cache when you redeploy because a CDN (content delivery network) would cache a static asset like `index.svelte.css` forever.

The `client` folder has client code including static assets like HTML, CSS and JavaScript and the `server` folder has server code including endpoints and you can gleam SvelteKit uses [Polka](https://github.com/lukeed/polka) as the web server.

What if you wanted to prerender the Pokemon once and cache it forever instead of having to rebuild it every time someone visits the page?

```js:index.svelte showLineNumbers
<script context="module">
	export let prerender = true
	// ...
</script>
```

If you run `npm run build` you're going to notice SvelteKit generated a `prerendered` folder.

```shell:terminal
.
├── api
│   └── pokemon.json
└── index.html
```

The `pokemon.json` file includes the `fetch` response so when you request the page it's going to send the prerendered `index.html` that has the `fetch` response inlined but you can go a step further and even disable hydration and the router for the page if you don't want to ship any JavaScript.

If you want you can even use `adapter-static` to generate a single-page application if you specify a [fallback page](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/adapter-static#spa-mode).

```js:svelte.config.js showLineNumbers
import adapter from '@sveltejs/adapter-static'

/** @type {import('@sveltejs/kit').Config} */
const config = {
	kit: {
    adapter: adapter({ fallback: 'index.html' }),
  }
}

export default config
```

Let's look at `adapter-vercel` because instead of a traditional Node server it uses serverless functions instead.

If I was SvelteKit and had to figure out how to create the output required for [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) I would probably start with their [documentation](https://vercel.com/docs/build-output-api/v3) but thankfully we don't have to.

> The Build Output API closely maps to the Vercel product features in a logical and easy-to-understand format. It is primarily targeted toward authors of web frameworks who would like to utilize all of the Vercel platform features, such as Serverless Functions, Edge Functions, Routing, Caching, etc.

Let's change the adapter to use `adapter-vercel`.

```js:svelte.config.js showLineNumbers
import adapter from '@sveltejs/adapter-vercel'

/** @type {import('@sveltejs/kit').Config} */
const config = {
	kit: {
		adapter: adapter(),
}

export default config
```

This is going to create a `.vercel_build_output` folder at the root.

```shell:terminal
.
├── config
│   └── routes.json
├── functions
│   └── node
│       └── render
│           ├── index.js
│           └── package.json
└── static
    └── _app
        ├── immutable
        │   ├── assets
        │   │   └── pages
        │   │       └── index.svelte.css
        │   ├── chunks
        │   │   └── index.js
        │   ├── error.svelte.js
        │   ├── layout.svelte.js
        │   ├── manifest.json
        │   ├── pages
        │   │   ├── counter.svelte.js
        │   │   └── index.svelte.js
        │   └── start.js
        └── version.json
```

As you can see it's very similar to what we've seen before only it's tailored for Vercel and I hope this makes it more clear how these things work.

Inside the `config` folder is a `routes.json` files that is responsible for URL overrides and pages are inside the `static` folder with the same structure as before but the endpoints are now inside a serverless `functions` folder that has the server logic.

## Summary

Hope I didn't lose you but more importantly I hope reading the post didn't leave an impression like you have to understand everything because I don't even after spending hours looking at the source code.

Here's the takeaway:

- SvelteKit is a backend framework and compiler
- You write your frontend and backend code in one place
- SvelteKit uses the web platform
- Server-side rendering has improved performance and SEO
- Pages are rendered on the server and client because of hydration
- Adapters are used to deploy to different target platforms

Thank you for reading! 🏄️
