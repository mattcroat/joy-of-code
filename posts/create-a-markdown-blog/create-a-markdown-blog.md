# Create a Markdown Blog Using Next.js

{% embed src="https://thedigitalgarden.vercel.app" title="JavaScript Sandbox" %}

## Table of Contents

You can play around with the example and you can find the [source code on GitHub](https://github.com/JoysOfCode/markdown-blog) if you want to use it.

## Your Digital Garden

Despite popular platforms for developers to author and share content with others you should have your own place on the internet — your own **digital garden.**

I set out to create something that I would use based on what I think a **Markdown** blog should have instead of leaving you with something barely usable. Everyone loves building **Markdown** blogs because it's an excuse to learn and be creative.

If you wonder "Why not just use [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/)?" it's because I consider it **easy but not simple** like [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/) where you don't understand how any of it works because the abstraction is so high (I would even argue it's more complicated to learn because how it's tied to [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/)).

For this reason I'm using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) because while you have to do more work you get to learn a lot more — in fact you're going to be surprised how little code we're going to write.

Understanding **React** is required but I'm going to try to keep it beginner friendly if you never used **Next.js** before and we're going to be using **TypeScript** which is **optional**, so you can completely ignore it and just use **JavaScript**.

## List of Features

These are the features I want from a **Markdown** blog that we're going to implement:

- **Dark mode**
- **MDX** for a rich user experience
- **Syntax highlight** (line numbers, line highlight and copying code)
- **Order posts** by oldest to newest
- **Filter posts** by category
- **Meta tags** (SEO and social share images)
- **Table of contents** (autogenerated for us)
- [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/) to add more features
- **Smart typography** (real quotes and ellipses)

## How Does it Work

We're going to create the **URL slug** from the post title such as `post.mdx` and have **Next.js** build the page for every post, so we can access it at `http://localhost:3000/post`.

{% img src="site-diagram.webp" alt="Site diagram" %}

**Markdown**

[Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) is popular because it's easy to author content, so we don't have to write **HTML** by hand or use a clumsy [WYSWYG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG) solution that can't keep up with your intent.

**MDX**

We're going to use [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) (JSX in **Markdown**) because it lets us use **React** components inside **Markdown**.

**Static Generated**

The site itself is **static generated** meaning **Next.js** is going to build every post in advance at **build time** when it deploys to **Vercel** meaning it's going to be fast once it's cached on their [CDN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network) (content delivery network). **Static** doesn't mean not dynamic because we're still using **React** on the page.

**Styles**

For the styles we're going to use a **CSS-in-JS** solution [styled-jsx](https://github.com/vercel/styled-jsx) mostly because it works out of the box with **Next.js** and using it is similar to a **single file component** if you ever used **Vue** or **Svelte**. I expect you to use your preferred styling method but if you want to stick with **styled-jsx** you can get [styled-jsx Syntax Highlighting](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Divlo.vscode-styled-jsx-syntax) and [styled-jsx Language Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Divlo.vscode-styled-jsx-languageserver) extension for [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for highlighting and code completion. Nothing here is specific to **CSS-in-JS** other than giving us **scoped styles**, so feel free to use any **CSS** solution for **React** you prefer.

**Deployment**

For deployment we're going to use **Vercel**, so whenever we push a change to **GitHub** it's going to rebuild and deploy the site to **Vercel**.

## Project Setup

Let's initialize a **Next.js** project using **TypeScript** but feel free to exclude the `--typescript` flag if you don't want to use it. Name the project whatever you want.

```shell:terminal
npx create-next-app --typescript
```

After you start the development server the page should be available at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) (read your terminal).

```shell:terminal
npm run dev
```

Let's remove things we aren't using:

- **api** folder inside **pages**
- Everything inside the **styles** folder
- Styles import in **pages/\_app.tsx**
- Everything inside **pages/index.tsx**

```tsx:pages/index.tsx showLineNumbers
export default function Home() {
  return <h1>Home</h1>
}
```

After you're done you should see **Home** on your page. (You might need to manually reload the page in case HMR doesn't work)

Let's also set up [module path aliases](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/module-path-aliases) inside `tsconfig.json`, so we can import things **relative to the root of our project**. This lets us import a file such as `'../../Component'` using `'@/root/components/Component'` instead not having to think about where it's located.

```json:tsconfig.json {4, 6} showLineNumbers
{
  "compilerOptions": {
  // ...
	"baseUrl": ".",
	"paths": {
      "@/root/*": ["./*"]
	}
  },
  // ...
}
```

You can set as many **path aliases** as you want such as for **components**, **styles** and whatever else you want but I prefer keeping it simple.

## Next.js Folder Structure

Here is an explanation of the **Next.js** folder structure in your file explorer.

**.next**

This is the **Next.js** cache and build output.

**pages**

**Next.js** uses a **file system based router** where every file you create is a page like **PHP**. For example `pages/about.tsx` would map to `http://localhost:3000/about`. You can also have **dynamic routes** which is awesome. **Next.js** has special files such as **\_app.tsx** that's a wrapper around every page and **\_document.tsx** to get access to the `<html>` and `<body>` tags.

**api**

These are your **API endpoints** using **serverless functions** meaning you don't need to use a real server for simple things. For example you can scrape a site and serve the **JSON** as a response you can render in your **frontend**, or **store it inside a database**. You **can't** create, or write to files since **serverless functions** are ephemereal and don't have storage because they spin up once per request.

**public**

Holds your **static assets** such as images.

**styles**

This is where you can keep your **CSS** but it's not convention.

**eslintrc.json**

Your **ESLint** linting rules.

**next-env.d.ts**

Makes sure **Next.js** types are picked up by **TypeScript**.

**next.config.js**

Let's you extend the **Webpack** config for **Next.js** without having to **eject**.

**tsconfig.json**

**TypeScript** compiler options. You're going to use **jsconfig.json** if you're using **JavaScript**.

Some things like `pages` are convention in **Next.js** but other things like **styles** and where you put your components is up to you.

## Next.js File System Based Router

We need a way to generate pages when we build our site.

Imagine what a chore it would be if we created a new page for every post such as `pages/post1.tsx`, `pages/post2.tsx` and so on. We can instead create a **dynamic route** such as `pages/[slug].tsx`, so that we can create pages on the fly based on the posts we create.

We're going to get those paths from the **file system** because we can use **Node.js** inside **Next.js** pages. This is possible because **Next.js** has **special functions** `getStaticPaths` and `getStaticProps` that we can only use inside a page, so we can **pre-render the page at build time**.

{% img src="next-page-render.webp" alt="Next.js page render" %}

In the example we have `[slug].tsx` inside `pages`, so **Next.js** expects us to specify a **slug** that can be any path as the **param** and that's why we created paths for [http://localhost:3000/post-1](http://localhost:3000/1) and [http://localhost:3000/post-2](http://localhost:3000/2).

This means we generate the **paths** and **props** in advance. The **props** are then sent to the **component** like regular **props**.

This is how a **Next.js** page looks like.

```tsx:pages/[slug].tsx {2, 8, 9, 18} showLineNumbers
export default function Post(props) {
  return <h1>{props.title}</h1>
}

export async function getStaticPaths() {
  return {
    paths: [
      { params: { slug: 'post-1' } },
      { params: { slug: 'post-2' } }
	],
    fallback: false,
  }
}

export async function getStaticProps() {
  return {
    props: {
      title: 'Post',
    },
  }
}
```

**Next.js** is flexible, so we can specify per page if we want it to be **SSG** (server-side generated) meaning **Next.js** builds the pages during **build time**, or **SSR** (server-side rendered) using `getServerSideProps` where you have to request the page from the server.

Since this code gets executed **server-side** in **Node.js** land in some **ephemeral serverless function** it's not part of the bundle.

This was just a brief introduction to **Next.js** but if you want to learn **Next.js** read the [Next.js basics](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app).

## Showing Posts

Let's start with the most interesting part which is showing **Markdown** posts.

For this we're going to use [mdx-bundler](https://github.com/kentcdodds/mdx-bundler) that's going to help us with reading **Markdown** files and bundle any dependencies we have such as **React** components which is awesome because it's framework agnostic unlike [next-mdx-remote](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-remote).

```shell:terminal
npm i mdx-bundler esbuild
```

[esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) is just an extremely fast **JavaScript** bundler that **mdx-bundler** uses.

Let's add some example posts by creating a `posts` folder at the root of our project (same place where your `package.json` is). Inside `posts` we're going to create at least two folders with posts following this structure:

- `posts/post-1/post-1.mdx`
- `posts/post-2/post-2.mdx`

At the top of every **Markdown** file we're going to include the **title**, **description**, **published**, **category**, **slug** and **social share image** metadata that we can parse as **front matter**.

```md:post-1.mdx showLineNumbers
---
title: First Post
description: This is the first post
slug: 'post-1'
published: '2021-10-10'
category: 'javascript'
image: '/images/post-1/social-image.png'
---

import { Counter } from './Counter'

# First Post

This is the first post.

You can use regular Markdown inside here like *italic* or **bold**.

Here's a component.

<Counter />
```

```md:post-2.mdx showLineNumbers
---
title: Second Post
description: This is the second post
slug: 'post-2'
published: '2021-10-20'
category: 'javascript'
image: '/images/post-2/social-image.png'
---

# Post 2

This is the second post.

If you had an image:

![Description](/images/post-2/image.webp)
```

If you want to use an image don't include `public` in the path but just `/images/post-2/image.webp` because **Next.js** is going to serve it from [http://localhost:3000/images/post-2/image.webp](http://localhost:3000/images/post-2/image.webp).

I haven't included any **social share images** here but in my other post I explain how you can [automate creating dynamic social share images](https://joyofcode.xyz/dynamic-social-share-images) and later I'm going to show you what `<meta>` tags to include. If you just want to know the dimensions it should be **1200px** by **630px** in size.

We're going to include a `<Counter />` component for `post-1`:

- `posts/post-1/Counter.tsx`

```tsx:posts/post-1/Counter.tsx showLineNumbers
import { useState } from 'react'

export function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

Create `[slug].tsx` inside the `pages` directory that's going to be responsible for our posts:

- `pages/[slug].tsx`

We're going to use **Node.js** to read from the **file system** and create **paths** based on the posts we have. First we're going to get the post names.

```ts:example.ts showLineNumbers
import fs from 'fs'

// post paths
const currentDirectory = process.cwd()
const posts = fs.readdirSync(`${currentDirectory}/posts`)
const postPaths = posts.map((post) => post)

// [ 'post-1', 'post-2' ]
```

Then we're going to `map` over the **paths** to create **slugs** in the format that **Next.js** expects.

```ts:example.ts showLineNumbers
// paths
const paths = postPaths.map((path) => ({
  params: { slug: path },
}))

/*
[
  { params: { slug: 'post-1' } },
  { params: { slug: 'post-2' } }
]
*/
```

At the end this is our `getStaticPaths`.

```tsx:pages/[slug].tsx showLineNumbers
export async function getStaticPaths() {
  // post paths
  const currentDirectory = process.cwd()
  const posts = fs.readdirSync(`${currentDirectory}/posts`)
  const postPaths = posts.map((post) => post)

  // paths
  const paths = postPaths.map((path) => ({
    params: { slug: path },
  }))

  return {
    paths,
    fallback: false,
  }
}
```

The `fallback: false` means that it should return a **404 page** if not found. If you don't include this **Next.js** would complain.

When you're using `getStaticPaths` you also have to use `getStaticProps`.

After we create the **paths** we can take the **slug** from the **URL**. For example when someone visits [http://localhost:3000/post-1](http://localhost:3000/post-1) we can find the post by **post-1** and parse it using **mdx-bundler**.

```tsx:pages/[slug].tsx showLineNumbers
export async function getStaticProps({ params }) {
  // slug
  const { slug } = params

  // post path
  const currentDirectory = process.cwd()
  const postPath = `${currentDirectory}/posts/${slug}/${slug}.mdx`
  const markdown = await bundleMDX({ file: postPath, ...options })
  const { code, frontmatter: metadata } = markdown

  return {
    props: {
      code,
      metadata,
    },
  }
}
```

`getStaticProps` taks a `context` argument from where we destructure `params`.

After we parse the post using `bundleMDXFile` we get the bundled `code` that we can use on the frontend to create a component using `getMDXComponent`.

We also have `metadata` from the **front matter** we can use for **SEO** later.

```tsx:pages/[slug].tsx showLineNumbers
import { useMemo } from 'react'
import { getMDXComponent } from 'mdx-bundler/client'

interface PostProps {
  code: string
  metadata: any
}

export default function Post({ code, metadata }: PostProps) {
  // avoid recreating the component every render
  const Component = useMemo(() => getMDXComponent(code), [code])
  return <Component />
}
```

If you navigate to [http://localhost:3000/post-1](http://localhost:3000/post-1) you should see the post.

{% img src="mdx-component.webp" alt="MDX component" %}

This took barely any code and we have a working blog that we understand how it works. If you need to catch up this is how `[slug].tsx` should look like.

```tsx:pages/[slug.tsx] showLineNumbers
import { useMemo } from 'react'
import { bundleMDXFile } from 'mdx-bundler'
import { getMDXComponent } from 'mdx-bundler/client'
import fs from 'fs'

interface PostProps {
  code: string
  metadata: any
}

interface Params {
  params: {
    slug: string
  }
}

export default function Post({ code, metadata }: PostProps) {
  // avoid recreating the component every render
  const Component = useMemo(() => getMDXComponent(code), [code])
  return <Component />
}

export async function getStaticPaths() {
  // post paths
  const currentDirectory = process.cwd()
  const posts = fs.readdirSync(`${currentDirectory}/posts`)
  const postPaths = posts.map((post) => post)

  // paths
  const paths = postPaths.map((path) => ({
    params: { slug: path },
  }))

  return {
    paths,
    fallback: false,
  }
}

export async function getStaticProps({ params }: Params) {
  // slug
  const { slug } = params

  // post path
  const currentDirectory = process.cwd()
  const postPath = `${currentDirectory}/posts/${slug}/${slug}.mdx`
  const markdown = await bundleMDX({ file: postPath, ...options })
  const { code, frontmatter: metadata } = markdown

  return {
    props: {
      code,
      metadata,
    },
  }
}

```

I urge you to `console.log` everything to see how it works — keep in mind logs inside special **Next.js** functions only show inside your **terminal** because it happens on the server (I still fall for that one).

## Markdown Plugins

There are [remark plugins](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/blob/main/doc/plugins.md) that process **Markdown** and [rehype plugins](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype/blob/main/doc/plugins.md) that process **HTML** after it's converted from **Markdown**. You can use both, so you don't have to know the difference.

If a plugin doesn't work you're out of luck unless there's another one because we're using [xdm](https://github.com/wooorm/xdm) that's a more modern **Markdown** compiler. For our purposes we're going to get a bunch of **plugins** like `rehype-prism-plus` that uses [Prism](https://prismjs.com/) for **syntax highlighting**.

If you want to see what the plugins do head over to the [features page](https://thedigitalgarden.vercel.app/features) of the finished project.

```shell:terminal
npm i rehype-code-titles rehype-image-placeholder rehype-prism-plus remark-gfm remark-autolink-headings remark-slug @silvenon/remark-smartypants remark-toc remark-unwrap-images
```

Inside `[slug].tsx` in `getStaticProps` we can pass a second `options` parameter to `bundleMDXFile`.

```tsx:[pages/slug.tsx] {18-48, 53} showLineNumbers
import { BundleMDXOptions } from 'mdx-bundler/dist/types'
import type {ProcessorOptions} from '@mdx-js/esbuild/lib'

// mdx plugins
import rehypeCodeTitles from 'rehype-code-titles'
import rehypeImagePlaceholder from 'rehype-image-placeholder'
import rehypePrism from 'rehype-prism-plus'
import remarkGfm from 'remark-gfm'
import remarkHeadings from 'remark-autolink-headings'
import remarkSlug from 'remark-slug'
import remarkSmartypants from '@silvenon/remark-smartypants'
import remarkTableofContents from 'remark-toc'
import remarkUnwrapImages from 'remark-unwrap-images'

export async function getStaticProps({ params }: Params) {
  // slug
  const { slug } = params

  // markdown plugins
  const options = {
    mdxOptions(options: ProcessorOptions) {
      options.remarkPlugins = [
        ...(options.remarkPlugins ?? []),
        // github flavored markdown
        remarkGfm,
        // add id to headings
        remarkHeadings,
        // add links to headings
        remarkSlug,
        // smart typographic punctuation like real quotes
        remarkSmartypants,
        // generates table of contents from headings
        // `tight` removes <p> from <li> when nested
        [remarkTableofContents, { tight: true }],
        // remove paragraph around images
        remarkUnwrapImages,
      ]
      options.rehypePlugins = [
        ...(options.rehypePlugins ?? []),
        // title for code blocks (has to come before `rehypePrism`)
        rehypeCodeTitles,
        // syntax highlight
        rehypePrism,
        // image dimensions and placeholder
        [rehypeImagePlaceholder, { dir: 'public' }],
      ]
      return options
    },
  }

  // post path
  const currentDirectory = process.cwd()
  const postPath = `${currentDirectory}/posts/${slug}/${slug}.mdx`
  const markdown = await bundleMDX({ file: postPath, ...options })
  const { code, frontmatter: metadata } = markdown

  return {
    props: {
      code,
      metadata,
    },
  }
}
```

Since some of the **plugins** don't have types we have to apease **TypeScript** by creating `types/global.d.ts` and say they exist.

```ts:types/global.d.ts showLineNumbers
declare module '@silvenon/remark-smartypants'
declare module 'rehype-image-placeholder'
```

While we're here, let's create `types/post.ts` and use that type instead of `any` for `PostProps`.

```ts:types/post.ts showLineNumbers
export interface Post {
  category: string
  description: string
  image: string
  published: number
  slug: string
  title: string
}
```

```tsx:pages/[slug].tsx showLineNumbers
// rename it to avoid name collision
import { Post as Metadata } from '@/root/types/post'

interface PostProps {
  code: string
  metadata: Metadata
}
```

## Markdown Component Substitution

We can replace any **Markdown** component we want using our own **React** components.

For example we can replace the regular `<img>` component with our own that uses [next/image](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/image) which is awesome because it serves images for us based on the size of the device and only loads the image when it's in view using **lazy loading**.

```tsx:example.tsx showLineNumbers
// image component
function Image(props) {
  // ...
}

// MDX components
const mdxComponents = {
  // using a component
  img: Image,
  // directly passing props
  img: (props) => <Image {...props} />
}

// inside [slug].tsx
function Post() {
  return <Component components={mdxComponents} />
}
```

Let's use that to implement our `<Image />` and `<CodeBlock />` component, so we can get the code from the `<pre>` content and copy it to the clipboard. First create `components` at the root and `mdx` folder inside with `Image.tsx`:

- `components/mdx/Image.tsx`

```tsx:components/mdx/Image.tsx showLineNumbers
import { useState } from 'react'
import NextImage from 'next/image'

interface ImageProps {
  src: string
  alt: string
  width: string
  height: string
  blurDataURL: string
}

export default function Image({
  src,
  alt,
  width,
  height,
  blurDataURL,
}: ImageProps) {
  const [loaded, setLoaded] = useState<boolean>(false)
  const zoom = loaded ? 'zoom' : ''

  return (
    <div className="container">
      <div className={zoom}>
        <NextImage
          onLoadingComplete={() => setLoaded(true)}
          src={src}
          alt={alt}
          width={width}
          height={height}
          loading="lazy"
          placeholder={blurDataURL ? 'blur' : undefined}
          blurDataURL={blurDataURL}
        />
      </div>

      <style jsx>
        {`
          .container {
            overflow: hidden;
          }

          .zoom {
            animation: zoom 0.3s linear;
          }

          @keyframes zoom {
            from {
              transform: scale(1.1);
            }
          }
        `}
      </style>
    </div>
  )
}
```

We're just passing basic `src` and `alt` image props alongside additional props we get from using the **image plugin** that gives us the `width` and `height` with the `blurDataURL` for the placeholder. After that we're just doing a simple zoom effect like you see on some sites when the image is loaded and `next/image` takes care of everything else.

If this is the first time you're seeing `styled-jsx` the only thing you have to know is that the styles only apply to the single component but you can also specify a `global` attribute.

Let's create `CodeBlock.tsx`:

- `components/mdx/CodeBlock.tsx`

```tsx:components/mdx/CodeBlock.tsx showLineNumbers
import { useRef } from 'react'

interface CodeBlockProps {
  children: React.ReactNode
}

export default function CodeBlock({ children }: CodeBlockProps) {
  const preRef = useRef<HTMLPreElement>(null)

  function copy() {
    const content = preRef.current?.textContent ?? ''
    navigator.clipboard.writeText(content)
  }

  return (
    <div className="code-block">
      <pre ref={preRef}>{children}</pre>
      <button onClick={copy} className="copy">
        <span className="sr-only">Copy</span>
        <span>📋</span>
      </button>

      <style jsx>
        {`
          .code-block {
            position: relative;
          }

          .copy {
            cursor: pointer;
            position: absolute;
            top: -34px;
            right: 20px;
            font-size: 1rem;
            background: none;
            border-radius: var(--border-base);
            border: none;
            transition: transform 0.1s ease;
          }

          .copy:active {
            transform: scale(0.9);
          }
        `}
      </style>
    </div>
  )
}
```

We're using a `ref` to get the contents of the `<pre>` element and copy the contents to the **clipboard** using the [Clipboard API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Clipboard_API).

Create `MDXComponents.tsx` where we can export the components:

- `components/mdx/MDXComponents.tsx`

```tsx:components/mdx/MDXComponents.tsx showLineNumbers
import CodeBlock from './CodeBlock'
import Image from './Image'

const mdxComponents = {
  img: Image,
  pre: CodeBlock,
}

export default mdxComponents
```

I also like to create a `index.ts` to export everything, so we can import doing `components/mdx` instead of `components/mdx/mdxComponents`:

- `components/mdx/index.ts`

```ts:components/mdx/index.ts
export { default } from './MDXComponents'
```

Import `mdxComponents` in `[slug].tsx` and pass it to `Component` using the `components` prop.

```tsx:pages/[slug].tsx showLineNumbers
// ...
import mdxComponents from '@/root/components/mdx'

// ...
<Component components={mdxComponents as any} />
```

## List Sorted Posts

Going back to our **home page** inside `index.ts` we're going to list the posts from **oldest to newest**.

We get the **paths** again but this time we're only interested in the **front matter** so we can use the **metadata** to render the cards. We're also going to turn the **date** into a **timestamp**, so we can sort it.

```tsx:pages/index.tsx showLineNumbers
import { bundleMDXFile } from 'mdx-bundler'
import fs from 'fs'

import { Post } from '@/root/types/post'
import Posts from '@/root/components/Posts'

interface HomeProps {
  posts: Post[]
}

export default function Home({ posts }: HomeProps) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Latest Posts</h2>
      <Posts posts={posts} />
    </div>
  )
}

export async function getStaticProps() {
  // post paths
  const currentDirectory = process.cwd()
  const posts = fs.readdirSync(`${currentDirectory}/posts`)

  // metadata from frontmatter
  const postsMetadata = []

  for (let post of posts) {
    const postPath = `${currentDirectory}/posts/${post}/${post}.mdx`
    const markdown = await bundleMDX({ file: postPath })
    const { frontmatter } = markdown

    const timestamp = new Date(frontmatter.published).valueOf()
    frontmatter.published = timestamp

    postsMetadata.push(frontmatter)
  }

  // sort posts by oldest to newest
  const sortedPosts = postsMetadata.sort(
    (firstEl, secondEl) => secondEl.published - firstEl.published
  )

  return {
    props: {
      posts: sortedPosts,
    },
  }
}

```

We also have to create the `<Posts />` component that just renders the posts:

- `components/Posts.tsx`

```tsx:pages/index.tsx showLineNumbers
import Link from 'next/link'

import { Post } from '@/root/types/post'

interface PostsProps {
  posts: Post[]
}

export default function Posts({ posts }: PostsProps) {
  return (
    <section>
      {posts.map(({ title, description, slug }) => (
        <article key={slug}>
          <Link href={`/${slug}`}>
            <a>{title}</a>
          </Link>
          <p>{description}</p>
        </article>
      ))}

      <style jsx>
        {`
          section {
            display: flex;
            flex-direction: column;
            gap: var(--spacing-1);
          }

          article {
            padding: var(--spacing-1);
            background-color: var(--color-post);
            border-radius: var(--radius-base);
          }

          a {
            font-size: var(--font-tertiary);
            color: var(--color-post-title);
          }

          p {
            color: var(--color-post-description);
          }
        `}
      </style>
    </section>
  )
}

```

Now if you navigate to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) you can see the sorted posts.

{% img src="sorted-posts.webp" alt="Sorted posts" %}

## Post Categories

At some point we're going to have a couple of posts, so it would be nice being able to filter them by category.

For example when a user visits [http://localhost:3000/category/javascript](http://localhost:3000/category/javascript) it should only show **JavaScript** posts. To create such a path we can create a `category` folder inside `pages` with `[category].tsx` inside:

- `pages/category/[category].tsx`

To achieve this we're going to use the `category` field from the post **front matter** and filter the posts based on it. We're going to keep a list of categories to create **paths** from.

```ts:example.ts
const categories = ['html', 'css', 'javascript'] as const
```

```ts:example.ts showLineNumbers
export async function getStaticPaths() {
  // paths
  const paths = categories.map((category) => ({
    params: { category },
  }))

  /*
  [
    { params: { category: 'html' } },
    { params: { category: 'css' } },
    { params: { category: 'javascript' } }
  ]
  */

  return {
    paths,
    fallback: false,
  }
}
```

We're also going to map the names to something more readable when rendering it.

```ts:example.ts showLineNumbers
const categoryName = {
  html: 'HTML',
  css: 'CSS',
  javascript: 'JavaScript',
}
```

We're going to get the `category` from the **URL** from `context.params` inside `getStaticProps`.

We need to get the **paths** to the posts because we have to read them and get the **front matter**. If the `frontmatter.category` matches `category` from the **URL** we know to filter those posts and sort them.

```tsx:pages/[category].tsx showLineNumbers
export async function getStaticProps(context: Context) {
  const { category } = context.params

  // get the post paths
  const currentDirectory = process.cwd()
  const postFoldersPath = `${currentDirectory}/posts`
  const postFolders = readdirSync(postFoldersPath)
  const postPaths = postFolders.map(
    (folder) => `${currentDirectory}/posts/${folder}/${folder}.mdx`
  )

  // get the posts
  const posts = []

  for (let path of postPaths) {
    const markdown = await bundleMDX({ file: path })
    const { frontmatter } = markdown

    if (frontmatter.category === category) {
      posts.push(frontmatter)
    }
  }

  // sort posts by oldest to newest
  const sortedPosts = posts.sort(
    (firstEl, secondEl) => secondEl.published - firstEl.published
  )

  return {
    props: {
      posts: sortedPosts,
      category,
    },
  }
}
```

If you need to catch up this is `[category].tsx`.

```tsx:pages/category/[category].tsx showLineNumbers
import { bundleMDXFile } from 'mdx-bundler'
import { readdirSync } from 'fs'

import { Post } from '@/root/types/post'
import Posts from '@/root/components/Posts'

interface CategoryProps {
  posts: Post[]
  category: typeof categories[number]
}

interface Context {
  params: {
    category: string
  }
}

const categories = ['html', 'css', 'javascript'] as const

const categoryName = {
  html: 'HTML',
  css: 'CSS',
  javascript: 'JavaScript',
}

export default function Category({ posts, category }: CategoryProps) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>{categoryName[category]}</h2>
      <Posts posts={posts} />
    </div>
  )
}

export async function getStaticPaths() {
  // paths
  const paths = categories.map((category) => ({
    params: { category },
  }))

  return {
    paths,
    fallback: false,
  }
}

export async function getStaticProps(context: Context) {
  const { category } = context.params

  // get the post paths
  const currentDirectory = process.cwd()
  const postFoldersPath = `${currentDirectory}/posts`
  const postFolders = readdirSync(postFoldersPath)
  const postPaths = postFolders.map(
    (folder) => `${currentDirectory}/posts/${folder}/${folder}.mdx`
  )

  // get the posts
  const posts = []

  for (let path of postPaths) {
    const markdown = await bundleMDX({ file: path })
    const { frontmatter } = markdown

    if (frontmatter.category === category) {
      posts.push(frontmatter)
    }
  }

  // sort posts by oldest to newest
  const sortedPosts = posts.sort(
    (firstEl, secondEl) => secondEl.published - firstEl.published
  )

  return {
    props: {
      posts: sortedPosts,
      category,
    },
  }
}
```

If you head over to [http://localhost:3000/category/javascript](http://localhost:3000/category/javascript) you can see the posts.

You can treat the **categories** as **tags** if for example you had `category: 'javascript, tips'` in your **front matter** you could `split` the string and get posts that are of type **JavaScript** and **tips** for your `javascript-tips` page.

## Navigation

Create the `Navigation.tsx` inside `components`:

- `components/Navigation.tsx`

The navigation has the `<Navigation />` component and `<Links />` components that just loops over `links`.

```tsx:components/Navigation.tsx showLineNumbers
import Link from 'next/link'

const links = [
  { location: '🌱 Digital Garden', url: '/' },
  { location: '🏷️ HTML', url: '/category/html' },
  { location: '😎 CSS', url: '/category/css' },
  { location: '📜 JavaScript', url: '/category/javascript' },
]

function Links() {
  return (
    <ol>
      {links.map(({ location, url }) => (
        <li key={location}>
          <Link href={url}>
            <a>{location}</a>
          </Link>
        </li>
      ))}

      <style jsx>
        {`
          ol {
            display: flex;
            flex-direction: column;
            gap: var(--spacing-1);
            list-style: none;
          }

          @media (min-width: 640px) {
            ol {
              display: flex;
              flex-direction: row;
              gap: var(--spacing-1);
            }
          }
        `}
      </style>
    </ol>
  )
}

export function Navigation() {
  return (
    <nav>
      <Links />

      <style jsx>
        {`
          nav {
            display: flex;
            flex-direction: column;
            gap: var(--spacing-1);
            padding: var(--spacing-2);
          }

          @media (min-width: 640px) {
            nav {
              max-width: var(--reading-length);
              margin: 0 auto;
              padding: var(--spacing-2) 0;
              flex-direction: row;
              justify-content: space-between;
              align-items: center;
            }
          }
        `}
      </style>
    </nav>
  )
}
```

We're going to use it inside a **layout** component after we to create the **SEO** component.

## SEO

Search engine optimization is important for search engines crawling your site and so are **social share images** that show up when you link your site or post on social media.

Here I included the `<meta>` tags you should have. You should only replace **your-site-url** with the **deployment URL** for example [https://thedigitalgarden.vercel.app/](https://thedigitalgarden.vercel.app/). You can create an **environment variable** if you want, so you don't have to change your source code if the link changes.

We use the default `meta` for a regular page and if it's a post we can pass the **metadata** from the **front matter** to override it.

Create `Seo.tsx` inside `components`:

- `components/Seo.tsx`

```tsx:components/Seo.tsx showLineNumbers
import Head from 'next/head'

export default function Seo({ ...metadata }) {
  const development = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development'
  const url = development ? 'http://localhost:3000' : 'your-site-url'

  const meta = {
    title: 'Digital Garden',
    description: `Description of the site`,
    image: `${url}/images/social-image.png`,
    ...metadata,
  }

  return (
    <Head>
      <title>{meta.title}</title>
      <meta content={meta.description} name="description" />

      <meta content={meta.title} property="og:title" />
      <meta content={meta.image} property="og:image" />
      <meta content={meta.description} property="og:description" />

      <meta content="summary_large_image" name="twitter:card" />
      <meta content={meta.title} name="twitter:title" />
      <meta content={meta.description} name="twitter:description" />
      <meta content={meta.image} name="twitter:image" />

      <link rel="icon" href="https://fav.farm/🌱" />
    </Head>
  )
}
```

## Styles

We're going to add **global styles** and **syntax highlight styles**. If you're curious how **syntax highlight** works it's simple. Using the `rehype-prism-plus` **Markdown** plugin from earlier we break the code into **tokens** using [Prism](https://prismjs.com/) that has a lot of themes we can use and target using **CSS**.

I did the tedious job of turning everything into [CSS variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/--*) from the **font family**, **colors** and **spacing** to **tokens**, so you can create your own themes. All the variables including **tokens** are inside `style.ts`. We're going to separate the styles because they're long and it's going to be easier to manage.

Inside the `styles` folder create:

- `styles/style.ts`
- `styles/prism.ts`

```ts:styles/style.ts showLineNumbers
import css from 'styled-jsx/css'

const styles = css.global`
  @import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Noto+Sans+Mono:wght@400;700&family=Poppins:wght@400;700;900&display=swap');

## Layout

This is the general layout of the site but for posts we use a grid where we extend images and code blocks outside the grid because it looks cool.

{% img src="layout.webp" alt="Site layout" %}

We're going to create a general layout wrapper for regular pages and one for our posts that's going to hold the **navigation** and **SEO**.

Create the `layout` folder inside `components` with `Blog.tsx` and `Container.tsx`:

- `components/layout/Blog.tsx`
- `components/layout/Container.tsx`

Let's first edit `Blog.tsx`.

```tsx:components/layout/Blog.tsx showLineNumbers
import { Navigation } from '@/root/components/Navigation'
import styles from '@/root/styles/style'
import prism from '@/root/styles/prism'
import Seo from '@/root/components/Seo'
import { Post } from '@/root/types/post'

interface BlogProps {
  children: React.ReactNode
  metadata?: Post
}

export default function Blog({ children, metadata }: BlogProps) {
  return (
    <div>
	  <Seo {...metadata} />
      <Navigation />
      <main className="post">{children}</main>

	  <style jsx global>
        {styles}
      </style>

      <style jsx global>
        {prism}
      </style>
    </div>
  )
}
```

We're going to target the elements inside `post` using **CSS** in our global styles. Inside `[slug].tsx` we can wrap `<Component />` with `<Blog />` and pass it `metadata`.

```tsx:components/[slug].tsx {2, 9-11} showLineNumbers
// ...
import Blog from '@/root/components/layout/Blog'

// ...
export default function Post({ code, metadata }: PostProps) {
  const Component = useMemo(() => getMDXComponent(code), [code])

  return (
    <Blog metadata={metadata}>
      <Component components={mdxComponents as any} />
    </Blog>
  )
}
```

Let's do the same for `Container.tsx` that's meant to be used for other general pages.

```tsx:components/layout/Container.tsx showLineNumbers
import { Navigation } from '@/root/components/Navigation'
import Seo from '@/root/components/Seo'
import styles from '@/root/styles/style'
import prism from '@/root/styles/prism'
import { Post } from '@/root/types/post'

interface ContainerProps {
  children: React.ReactNode
  metadata?: Post
}

export default function Container({ children, metadata }: ContainerProps) {
  return (
    <div>
      <Seo {...metadata} />
      <Navigation />
      <main>{children}</main>

      <style jsx>
        {`
          main {
            padding: 0 var(--spacing-2);
          }

          @media (min-width: 640px) {
            main {
              width: var(--reading-length);
              margin: 0 auto;
              padding: var(--spacing-2) 0;
            }
          }
        `}
      </style>

      <style jsx global>
        {styles}
      </style>

      <style jsx global>
        {prism}
      </style>
    </div>
  )
}
```

Then use it for the **home page** inside `index.tsx`.

```tsx:pages/index.tsx {2, 7-10} showLineNumbers
// ...
import Container from '@/root/components/layout/Container'

// ...
export default function Home({ posts }: HomeProps) {
  return (
    <Container>
      <h2>Latest Posts</h2>
      <Posts posts={posts} />
    </Container>
  )
}
```

## Dark Mode

So far everything works except our colors because we're applying them based on if `<body>` has the **data attribute** of **dark** or **light**. We just need to create the dark mode toggle `ThemeToggle.tsx` inside `components`:

- `components/ThemeToggle.tsx`

The component has a `<ThemeToggle />` component that has the logic and a presentational `<Toggle />` component.

I found the [toggle component on Codepen](https://codepen.io/havardob/pen/MWawKVy) and cleaned it up and turned the values into **CSS variables**.Thanks to [Adding a Dark / Light Mode Toggle to Next.js Using CSS Variables](https://electricanimals.com/articles/next-js-dark-mode-toggle) because it explains how to solve the flashing issue when you save a theme to [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) and refresh the page because of how **server-side hydration** works.

```tsx:components/ThemeToggle.tsx showLineNumbers
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react'

interface ToggleProps {
  checked: boolean
  toggle: () => void
}

function Toggle({ checked, toggle }: ToggleProps) {
  return (
    <div className="toggle">
      <input onChange={toggle} type="checkbox" id="toggle" checked={checked} />
      <label htmlFor="toggle">
        <span className="sr-only">Dark Mode Toggle</span>
      </label>

      <style jsx>
        {`
          .toggle {
            --width: 80px;
            --height: 40px;
            --radius-circle: 20px;
            --translate-x-moon: 34px;
            --translate-x-mask: 96px;

            transition: var(--transition-color);
          }

          label {
            width: var(--width);
            height: var(--height);
            display: block;
            position: relative;
            background-color: var(--color-toggle);
            border-radius: 50px;
            overflow: hidden;
            cursor: pointer;
          }

          label:before,
          label:after {
            content: '';
            width: var(--radius-circle);
            height: var(--radius-circle);
            position: absolute;
            top: 10px;
            left: 14px;
            border-radius: 50%;
            transition: transform 0.5s ease;
          }

          label:before {
            background-color: var(--color-toggle-sun);
          }

          label:after {
            background-color: var(--color-toggle-mask);
            left: -58px;
          }

          input[type='checkbox'] {
            display: none;
          }

          input[type='checkbox']:checked + label:before {
            background-color: var(--color-toggle-moon);
            transform: translateX(var(--translate-x-moon));
          }

          input[type='checkbox']:checked + label:after {
            transform: translateX(var(--translate-x-mask));
          }
        `}
      </style>
    </div>
  )
}

export default function ThemeToggle() {
  const selectedTheme = document.body.dataset.theme ?? 'dark'
  const [theme, setTheme] = useState<string>(selectedTheme)
  const checked = theme === 'dark' ? true : false
  const flipTheme = theme === 'dark' ? 'light' : 'dark'

  useEffect(() => {
    document.body.dataset.theme = theme
    localStorage.setItem('theme', theme)
  }, [theme])

  function handleToggle() {
    setTheme(flipTheme)
  }

  return <Toggle checked={checked} toggle={handleToggle} />
}

```

As mentioned from the post I linked to get the theme from the browser we have to first get the value before **Next.js** hydrates the page. If you remember from earlier we can hook into the **DOM** using `_document.tsx`, so create it:

- `pages/_document.tsx`

If you changed `_document.tsx` you might have to restart the development server. Most of this is just **Next.js** boilerplate from [the documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/custom-document). The only thing we added is `setInitialTheme` and inserted the `<script>`.

```tsx:_document.tsx showLineNumbers
import Document, {
  Html,
  Head,
  Main,
  NextScript,
  DocumentContext,
} from 'next/document'

export default class MyDocument extends Document {
  static async getInitialProps(ctx: DocumentContext) {
    const initialProps = await Document.getInitialProps(ctx)
    return { ...initialProps }
  }

  render() {
    const setInitialTheme = `
      function getUserPreference() {
        if (window.localStorage.getItem('theme')) {
          return window.localStorage.getItem('theme')
        }

        return window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').matches
          ? 'dark'
          : 'light'
      }

      document.body.dataset.theme = getUserPreference()
    `

    return (
      <Html>
        <Head />
        <body>
          <script dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: setInitialTheme }} />
          <Main />
          <NextScript />
        </body>
      </Html>
    )
  }
}
```

After that we have to dynamically load the `<ThemeToggle />` component using `next/dynamic` to avoid running the code on the server. We're going to add it inside `Navigation.tsx`.

```tsx:components/Navigation.tsx {2, 5, 11, 12} showLineNumbers
// ...
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic'

// we don't want to run the code on the server
const ThemeToggle = dynamic(() => import('./ThemeToggle'), { ssr: false })

// ...
export function Navigation() {
  return (
    <nav>
      <Links />
      <ThemeToggle />
    </nav>
  )
}

```

We have a working theme we can save to **local storage** but we also respect the user's preference if no theme is set.

## Deploy

You don't have to pay anything for hosting your **static site** unless for some weird reason you're uploading **gigabytes** of images. Even **server-side rendering** doesn't cost anything because when someone visits a page it's going to request it once and then cache it for others.

If your project is **open source** and **non-commercial** you can [request a sponsorship](https://vercel.com/support/articles/can-vercel-sponsor-my-open-source-project) from **Vercel**. You can deploy the site in a couple of steps:

- Push your project to [GitHub](https://github.com/)
- Create an account on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
- When you're logged in to **Vercel** tap the **New Project** button
- Point **Vercel** to your repository

{% img src="vercel.webp" alt="Deployment to Vercel" %}

You shouldn't have any problems but you can always try `npm run build` on your machine to see if your site builds first and solve any issues before you deploy. If you come across any errors don't panic but calmly read the **log output** because it's just like reading your terminal but it's on another server.

You can also change the **URL** that's generated for you to something else with **\*.vercel.app** at the end also at no cost. If you want a cheap domain name **.xyz** domains are around **$1 / year** on [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/) and I use it for this site and my portfolio.

## Conclusion

Congrats! 🥳

You can get the [final project files](https://github.com/JoysOfCode/markdown-blog) here.

I hope you learned about **Next.js** but more importantly I hope you're going to write and share your knowledge with others.

Have a look at [Shiki](https://github.com/shikijs/shiki) if you want to play around with a modern **syntax highlighter**. You can also create more themes like I have on [Joy of Code](https://joyofcode.xyz/) by giving the theme a name and targeting it with `body[data-theme='theme']` in **CSS**.

Thanks for reading! 🏄
