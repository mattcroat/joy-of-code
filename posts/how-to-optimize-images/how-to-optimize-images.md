# How to Optimize Images

## Table of Contents

## Image Optimization is a Pain

If you're using images anywhere hosting is only part of the equation since you have to make sure they're optimized for your users.

There's just one problem ‚Äî **it's a giant pain**.

## Squoosh

[Squoosh](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/squoosh) is a project by Google that optimizes your images right in the browser.

{% img src="squoosh.webp" alt="Squoosh" %}

The [Squoosh app](https://squoosh.app/) has a delightful user interface. The only downside is that it takes a couple of steps for every image which can get tedious.

## Using the Squoosh CLI

Thankfully we can use the [Squoosh CLI](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/squoosh/tree/dev/cli) (command-line interface) to automate it.

You can invoke the **Squoosh CLI** using the `npx` command which just downloads and executes the binary in `node_modules`.

```shell:terminal
npx @squoosh/cli -h
```

This is going to show us the options.

```shell:terminal
Usage: squoosh-cli [options] <files...>

Options:
  -V, --version                                          output the version number
  -d, --output-dir <dir>                                 Output directory (default: ".")
  -s, --suffix <suffix>                                  Append suffix to output files (default: "")
  --max-optimizer-rounds <rounds>                        Maximum number of compressions to use for auto optimizations (default: "6")
  --optimizer-butteraugli-target <butteraugli distance>  Target Butteraugli distance for auto optimizer (default: "1.4")
  --resize [config]                                      Resize the image before compressing
  --quant [config]                                       Reduce the number of colors used (aka. paletting)
  --rotate [config]                                      Rotate image
  --mozjpeg [config]                                     Use MozJPEG to generate a .jpg file with the given configuration
  --webp [config]                                        Use WebP to generate a .webp file with the given configuration
  --avif [config]                                        Use AVIF to generate a .avif file with the given configuration
  --jxl [config]                                         Use JPEG-XL to generate a .jxl file with the given configuration
  --wp2 [config]                                         Use WebP2 to generate a .wp2 file with the given configuration
  --oxipng [config]                                      Use OxiPNG to generate a .png file with the given configuration
  -h, --help                                             display help for command
```

The only problem is that after this the documentation stops and provides no examples.

The only clue you're left with are the [config options](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/squoosh/blob/dev/libsquoosh/src/codecs.ts) for the image format you want but I managed to figure it out after some investigation.

Let's say you want to optimize your images using the **\*.webp** format.

```shell:terminal
npx @squoosh/cli --webp '{ quality: 100, lossless: 1 }' -d output *
```

In the example we're using the highest **quality** but only use **lossless** if the colors of the image look washed out because it's going to increase the file size.

- You have to pass it the **image format** flag such as `--webp`
- Then give it **options**
- Specify the **output** with the `-d` flag followed by the **name of the output folder** which is **output** in this case
- Specify the **files** where `*` means everything

After you run it you should see an output in your **terminal**, so you know it worked.

## Conclusion

Image optimization is important and sometimes we're lucky enough that our development tools can do the job for us but that's not always the case or you want to have complete control over it.
