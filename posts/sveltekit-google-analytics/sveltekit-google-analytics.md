## Set Up Google Analytics

In this post you're going to learn how to set up Google Analytics and create a `<Analytics />` component you can use in SvelteKit.

> ⚠️ The post uses code snippets from Google Analytics which might cause some ad blockers to block resources on the page such as the images.

If you go to the [Google developers section for Google Analytics](https://developers.google.com/analytics) and select "Set up Google Analytics" and then select "Websites and web apps" it leads you to the [Introduction to Google Analytics 4](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/ga4) page.

From the [Get started with Google Analytics](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/ga4/get-started) introduction you have to go to [Set up Analytics for a website and/or app](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9304153).

1\. Create an Analytics account by going to **Admin** in [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/) and clicking **Create Account** and fill out the fields.

2\. After you signed away your soul to Google it's going to prompt you to add a **data stream** which you can always find in the column on the left when you get lost.

{% img src="data-streams.webp" alt="Set up a data stream to start collecting data prompt" %}

3\. After you select the **Web** as the platform the **data stream** is going to give you a public **Measurement ID** to use for tracking, so you don't have to worry about leaking it.

4\. You're going to find your **Measurement ID** in **Web stream details** alongside instructions on how to include Google Analytics on your site under **Tagging Instructions**.

The [Measure views](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/ga4/views?technology=websites) section on the Google developers page has more information on how to track views that's of interest.

I'm describing these steps in detail because I want you to understand how I find this information.

## Create The Analytics Component

After you get the **Measurement ID** from Google Analytics create a simple `<Analytics />` component you can use inside a layout.

> ⚠️ You might not need the reactive statement because by default Google Analytics is going to count the page view when the browser history changes.

```html:src/lib/analytics.svelte showLineNumbers
<script lang="ts">
  import { page } from '$app/stores'

  $: {
    if (typeof gtag !== 'undefined') {
      gtag('config', 'MEASUREMENT_ID', {
        page_title: document.title,
        page_path: $page.url.pathname,
      })
    }
  }
</script>

<svelte:head>
  <script
    async
    src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=MEASUREMENT_ID">
  </script>
  <script>
    window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || []

    function gtag() {
      dataLayer.push(arguments)
    }

    gtag('js', new Date())
    gtag('config', 'MEASUREMENT_ID')
  </script>
</svelte:head>
```

Optional step is to install the type definitions for `gtag.js` with `npm i -D @types/gtag.js`

This is how you can measure information such as the page title and page path using the SvelteKit store.

Because it's using a store value whenever the page gets updated inside the `$: { ... }` reactive block we can submit the new page view if `gtag` exists on `window` meaning it's inside the browser context.

> 🐿️ The curly boys inside the reactive block are optional but make the code easier to read as `$: if ...` works the same.

Include the `<Analytics />` component inside your main layout `__layout.svelte` making it available on every page.

```html:routes/__layout.svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import Analytics from '$lib/analytics.svelte'
</script>

<Analytics />

<slot />
```

That's it! 🎉

You should start receiving data in the next 30 minutes if you go to **Reports** under **Realtime** inside Google Analytics.

If performance is a concern you can use [Partytown](https://partytown.builder.io/) to run third-party scripts from a web worker.

Using Google Analytics is mostly about cost and convenience but if you don't have to use it consider trying [umami](https://umami.is/) that's a lighter alternative.

Thanks for reading! 🏄️
