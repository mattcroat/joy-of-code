<main>
  <p>Hey! ðŸ‘‹</p>
  <p>
    I'm <b>Matija</b> from ðŸ‡­ðŸ‡· <b>Croatia</b> and I'm infinitely curious at how
    things work but I'm mostly passionate about â˜•
    <b>JavaScript and</b>
    ðŸŽ¨
    <b>UI/UX design</b>.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm a huge advocate for using the web platform and I love working with <b
      >React</b
    >
    and <b>Svelte</b> using
    <b>TypeScript</b>
    and writing <b>plain CSS</b> because I love it.
  </p>
  <p>
    I created <b>Joy of Code</b> because I think a lot of tutorials don't help you
    learn how to solve problems but just read the documentation to you and go from
    point A to point B.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>I want to show you steps between A and B</strong> by sharing what I learn
    and how I think about solving problems.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm trying to create something I wish existed â€” it's more like having a
    friend help you out instead of someone talking over your head.
