<main>
	<p>Hey! 👋</p>
	<p>
		I'm <b>Matija</b> from 🇭🇷 <b>Croatia</b> and I'm infinitely curious at how
		things work but I'm mostly passionate about ☕
		<b>JavaScript and</b>
		🎨
		<b>UI/UX design</b>.
	</p>
	<p>
		I created <b>Joy of Code</b> because I think a lot of tutorials don't help you
		learn how to solve problems but just read the documentation to you and go from
		point A to point B.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>I want to show you steps between A and B</strong> by sharing what I learn
		and how I think about solving problems.
	</p>
	<p>
		I'm trying to create something I wish existed — it's more like having a
		friend help you out instead of someone talking over your head.
	</p>
