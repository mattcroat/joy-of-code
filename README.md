## 🧭 Uses

- ⚡️ [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) for the framework and prerendering pages ahead of time making it blazingly fast 🔥

## 📜 Setup

These instructions are mostly if you want to learn how the code works but in general **I don't accept pull requests that aren't related to posts** but you can always raise an issue.

The project uses 📦️ [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) but any package manager should work.
